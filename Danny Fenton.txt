Uh, actually, Dad? I want to be an astronaut. 
Oh no. 
(Off-screen) This isn't good. 
It uses what to track what? 
Actually...I need to tell you guys something. 
I think I should tell them. 
Sam, I-I'm talking about my powers, my problems? 
It's been a month since the accident and I still have barely any control! If somebody catches me, (Starts sinking into the floor while Sam and Tucker watch) I go from geek to freak around here! 
Gah, darn it! If my dad can invent something (Begins walking off-screen, Sam and Tucker follow him up the rest of the stairs.) that accidentally made me half-ghost, why can't he invent something that turns me back to normal? (Becomes intangible and walks through a snack machine without paying any attention.) 
She doesn't eat anything with a face on it. 
Impressive. 
What is this? Grass on a bun? 
Don't you think this is a little extreme, Sam? 
Uh, guys? I've got a problem. (A handful of mud suddenly lands on his head.) UGH! 
(Turns around and grimaces) ...Make that two problems. 
She's not my girlfriend! 
Uh...uh... (Glances down at the plate and picks it up, preparing to toss it.) GARBAGE FIGHT! 
Great. I'm still his favorite. 
Shouldn't she be haunting a bingo hall? 
Get behind me! 
I'm going ghost! 
(Seeming a little unsure of himself) I command you to...go away! 
Well, if this superhero thing doesn't work out, I can have an exciting career as a busboy. 
(Looks down at his hands in amazement) Hey! It worked! 
Forget it! The only thing that has an expiration date here is you! (Points at the Lunch Lady. Accidentally reverts to his human self.) Whoops! I didn't mean to do that. 
(Defensively:) Dash started it! He threw- 
Maybe because you told the ghost she changed the menu? How about that? 
Check it out. (Points at the screen.) Meat trail. 
How is it that I have the ghost powers and you're the weird kid? 
I'll take care of the ghost. You just find a way to get Sam out of that pile of meat! 
(Defensively:) What? Of course not! What would give you that idea? (Trails off.) 
(Confused:) Ah! Aah! Wha? What's going on? 
(Sits up quickly. Alarmed:) Four days?! 
Oh well. I'm sure everything will be back to normal by tomorrow. 
Or not. Maybe it'll be worse. 
(With disbelief:) You guys put together two protests in one night? 
Don't you guys think this is a little extreme? 
(Looks around.) Guys, time to makeup. Now! 
(While phasing through.) Thanks! 
Yeah. I think so. 
Wasn't expecting that. (Suddenly turns human again.) Or that. 
The Fenton Thermos! But how am I going to get it to work? 
Change back! CHANGE BACK! (A light flashes and he turns ghost again.) 
(While phasing through:) Thanks for the thermos! 
I'm changing the menu, permanently! (Grabs the top of the thermos. Small voice:) Please work. 
I hope I'm right! 
(Smiles down at the thermos.) My parents have their moments. 
Oh, sorry, Dad. (Points behind him with his thumb.) You just missed him. 
Nah. I think I might've finally figured out what these powers are for. They make me- 
(Looking pleased.) Whatever you say, Dash. (Looks at camera.) Whatever you say. 
Hey, Dad. What are you doing? 
Oh no. 
Da-? 
D-ahhh! (Runs away, terrified. Dora grabs him in her fist.) 
You'll have to stand in line behind my dad. In the meantime... (Goes ghost.) 
If that dragon suit's her idea of a costume, I'm on mummy's side. (Changes back to normal.) Phew! Man, that's a relief. 
Strike three, Tuck? 
(To Tucker:) How much change you got? 
I can't! I get weak-kneed when I try to talk to cute girls. 
Uh... 
(Takes a deep breath.) Hi! I... 
(Stands back up.) Yeah! I-I mean, no! T-that's not it. I'm...I'm Danny. 
(Sighs.) Man, I blew it yesterday. Paulina probably won't even look at me now. 
Or not! Hey, Tuck? 
(Overshadowing Dash; looks down at himself) --in Dash's body? 
Right! Of course! (Paulina stares at him suspiciously.) I'm also president of the Casper High geek club, and I have every toenail I've ever clipped. Want to see 'em? 
Oh, then you should get to know Danny Fenton. He doesn't scrub his mom's feet every night like I do. (Kneels and picks up Paulina's foot.) 
That? Oh! Uh, it's a...uh... You like it? (Smiles hopefully.) 
Hey, that's great! (Paulina stands up.) Because I, uh, got it for you. 
Yeah. (Stands up.) I-I-in case I got the nerve to ask you to the dance and you said yes, I thought I'd want to give you something and that's what it would have been. It's for you. (His pants turn invisible briefly and he grabs them before they fall.) Whether you go with me or not. 
(Smiling, then frowns.) What am I doing? That thing doesn't belong to me. It could be my mom's, or my sister's. 
Or I could worry about that later. Because she said yes! Woohoo! (Raises fists triumphantly in the air. His pants fall down.) 
Oh, man. My dad? 
(During fade-in.) Catch anything, Dad? 
Uh... (Holds up and points to the parent-teacher conference notice.) 
Well, sort of. Mr. Lancer-- 
Mr. Lancer... (Suddenly smiles and overshadows Jack, who is looking away. Jack's eyes turn green.) wants to have a word with us! 
(Overshadowing Jack) Well, sure! (Points to self.) I'm a parent, and that's...what parents do. Uh, right? 
Did his pants fall down again? Poor Danny. He studies so hard he forgets to eat. I know these things because I'm his dad and not him. (Smiles hopefully, leaning an arm on Lancer's desk.) 
(To himself:) It worked? (Lancer takes notice.) I-I-I mean, of course you understand. No wonder you're Danny's favorite teacher. 
We Fentons consider teachers to be underpaid and under-appreciated. (Smiles hopefully.) 
Chaperone? Well, I'm not sure... 
Yes, but he doesn't know he's going to chaperone because he doesn't remember that I made him say yes! 
Yeah, pretty much. 
(Glances at the girl, then back at Tucker.) Forget it. You can get your own date for the dance like I did. 
Why are you so down on her? So she's pretty. It's not a crime. 
Say, haven't we met somewhere? 
(Dodges the fire.) Let's try this again. Hi, I'm Danny Phantom. And you are? 
(Holding his head.) Testy, got it. 
Sorry, dude! I think you got the wrong weenie! 
Tea? Ooh, good idea. Coffee could make you a mite jittery. Better yet... 
(While flying back up through the ground.) Have some punch! (Punches her.) 
Fine. But that's the second time I've fought that dragon. We need to investigate. How are you guys? 
(Spits out water.) What?! Wh-what secret? 
(Panicked:) It's a lie, I'm not a ghost! (Realizes what Jazz said.) I-I mean...she's not my girlfriend. She's just going to the dance with me. 
(Sighs. Walking out the room:) I better go get ready. (Goes through door and walks down some stairs.) Okay, so I'm gonna have to dance with Paulina and keep my dad from embarrassing me. I can handle that. 
(Adjusting tie.) Tie straight. Shirt tucked in. (Picks up Fenton Fisher. While retracting the pole and putting it in his jacket:) Unbreakable ghost fishing line tucked neatly away just in case. (To Sam on his computer:) What's taking so long with that dragon research, Sam? 
That's it! (Clicks on "More Info" link. Reading:) Medieval ghostly legend held that the cursed Amulet of Aragon-- (Camera cuts to images of a human Dora wearing the amulet) --could transform any wearer into dragon form-- (Pans to image of the dragon's neck with the amulet) --under states of extreme emotional duress or anger. (Zooms in on the amulet the dragon is weariing) That's the amulet I gave to Paulina. (Camera cuts to Danny and Tucker) It must have accidentally fallen into my backpack. Wait. You mean...I'm going on a date with a dragon?! 
She really wants to go to the dance. 
We're her best friends. We should have known. 
(Overshadowing Tucker) She kinda cancelled on me. (Sam's eyebrows raise in surprise.) Do you think we could go together-- you know, as friends? 
Well, I understand if you don't want to go. (Begins to turn around to leave.) 
(Leaves Tucker's body and floats in air as Phantom. Saluting:) See ya! (Flies off.) 
(Practicing to himself:) Paulina, about the amulet. It's an ancient family heirloom and I need to get it back. (Smiles briefly, then slaps himself. Sighs.) No, that stinks. 
Uh, hi! Uh, you must be Paulina's dad. 
And I'm glad we had a chance to chat. (Walks away.) 
Paulina, I was thinking... That amulet-- 
Yeah, well, about that. See, I shouldn't have given it to you in the first place because...(Spots Sam standing with Tucker.) It belongs to Sam! 
(Handing her his glass.) Uh... But I want to make it up to you. I'll get you something else. Something...more special. 
Like punch! I'm gonna get you some special punch. (Runs off.) 
(As Jack) Yes! Danny, what a fine boy he is! Ha! Yes, as his father, I get that all the time. 
Oh, must be something I ate. (Spots punch table.) Hey! How 'bout I get us some punch? (Walking through students:) Excuse me! Excuse me! Adult coming through. I shave every day. (Walks to Tucker and Sam.) Tucker, Sam, we've got trouble. 
Tucker, it's me. It's Danny. (Hands them walkie-talkies.) Sam, you try to help me find Paulina. Tucker, keep an eye on my dad. If he starts talking to anyone, page me, got it? (Walks away.) 
(As Jack, on walkie-talkie:) Stay on her. I'm on my way. And Sam, don't make her angry. (Invisibly leaves Jack's body and takes walkie-talkie from his hand. Jack looks confused.) 
Paulina? Sam? 
(Lands.) Take it easy, Paulina. You don't want to hurt Sam. (Noticing Paulina in Sam's grasp.) Paulina? (Looks at Sam's face.) Sam?! 
Yep, that's Sam. (Sam breathes fire at him and he turns intangible to avoid it, then reappears.) Whoa! Sam! Two words: breath mints. 
Uh, sorry. 
Now, Sam, be reasonable. (His walkie-talkie beeps and he puts it to his ear.) 
I hate to do this, Sam. 
Oh, man. Dad! 
(As Jack) Right, right. I'm sorry, it's just in this light I thought you were George Clooney. Isn't he sharp, Mom? I mean, Maddie. 
Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to dance with my wife. That's what we adults do, dance with our wives. (Pulls Maddie to the dance floor and they begin to dance.) 
If by memories you mean things you remember that I don't, then yes! Go ahead and remind me of stuff. I'll totally agree to remembering. 
I hate to say this, but you throw fire like a girl! (Sam growls. He pulls out the Fenton Fisher.) The Fenton Fisher. (Flying towards Sam.) It can capture ghosts and dragon ghosts. (Casting line at Sam, which wraps around her neck.) Way to go, Dad! 
(Off-screen) Sam? (Light flashes as he transforms into Fenton. Cut to him kneeling down next to Sam.) Are you alright? 
Well, uh... (Chuckles.) Let's just say you had a roaring time. 
Sure, I'd love to. (Hands Tucker the amulet.) Keep an eye on this, will ya? (Tucker nods.) 
I'll do my best. 
Okay, can we get this over with? I've got a test to study for. 
(Sighs.) I don't have time for this! Hey Tucker, let's go! 
(Lands next to Tucker.) Seals: aquatic mammals that bark. They're canines, right? 
Come on, you guys. (Flies up in between them.) If you're gonna be superhero sidekicks, you're gonna have to be a little more focused. (To Sam:) You're supposed to be helping me study for the test tomorrow. (To Tucker:) And you're supposed to be helping me catch these ghosts so I have time to study! 
(Mocking her:) Who said yes? The person you asked if you were a conceited snob? 
So it is the swimsuit issue. (Frowns.) Oh, gross! Mom's gonna be in the swimsuit issue?! 
They're not ghost-hunting freaks. 
Uh, uh...boo? 
(Looks at family uncertainly.) I'd better get to school. 
(Off-screen) I got a "D?!" 
All this ghost hunting is taking away from my study time. 
I can't get a "D" in biology. My parents will kill me. 
(Walking to computer.) A purple-back gorilla? 
I don't have time for extra credit...or your agendas. 
(Sighs.) I don't know. 
Remember what happened when I let you manage the thermos? 
I suppose we could have a trial period. 
Sam, we've been watching the gorilla scratch his butt for, um, how long? 
(Yawns.) Time flies when you're majestically scratching your butt. 
I got him! I'm going ghost! 
Alright, I don't know how you got out, but you're going back. 
I wonder who let the gorilla go...Sam? 
Or we just keep it our little secret. 
(Off-screen, as Sam smirks.) No. 
Mom, come on. We're just a bunch of kids. In the zoo. At night. Alone. (Everyone stares at him.) We'll be in my room. (The trio goes upstairs.) 
Who are you? 
Hey, my rocket! I built that! 
Oh, don't worry. (Goes ghost and phases out of net.) I will! 
(Off-screen, after another crash upstairs.) MY COMPUTER! Oh, that's Jazz's. 
What are you doing? 
What?! 
Noooo! 
Who cares? At least I got a minute to relax and figure this out. 
D'oh! My room! 
Don't you people ever knock? (Slams door shut and leans against it.) Jazz is going to kill me for that. 
(Looking around.) Any sign of him? 
I think we'll blow that one off. 
I can't eat now. He could be anywhere. 
Yeah, almost like a schedule. What's the next thing you have scheduled for me, Tucker? 
Hey, Dash? I'm too weak and defenseless to open my locker. Can you open it for me? 
When Skulker put your PDA into his technology, he became bound to my schedule. He has to go where I was going to go next. (Checking Tucker's PDA.) Which means... (PDA reads "VISIT GORILLA HABITAT.") It's time for the hunter to become the hunted. Come on, I'm gonna go do something a little ahead of schedule. (He and Tucker run off-screen.) 
I can help with that. 
Power him down already. Now! 
(As Skulker puts away his bow.) Tucker, you're fired. 
Just this. (Pats head, covers eyes repeatedly, pounds chest with fists.) 
(Scratching his butt.) Calling a friend. 
Well, sure. All he does is this. (Continues scratching butt.) 
Thermos, please. 
Cool. Let's go home. 
Ah, that's okay. (Kneels down to pick up Skulker's PDA.) We stopped the bad guy, saved the gorilla. If that's all I got done, then that's-- (Sampson walks closer to him. Danny turns to look up at him, but is shocked at what he sees.) Oh my gosh! 
That's weird, huh? Well, maybe they were respecting her privacy. 
A "C?!" I almost get killed by a gho--rilla, and all I get is a "C?!" 
Oh man, if only I had something I could take this out on! 
(Going ghost.) Hello, misplaced aggression. 
Which is four more than I'll need. (He flies off-screen and starts fighting the Box Ghost.) 
Hey, Jazz. (Opens eyes and frowns.) Dash! W-what are you doing here? 
(Backing up back to the stairs.) Uh, sorry. I was just, uh, passing through. (Leaves and closes door.) 
Does it work? 
Dad, couldn't you just throw it into... 
Reverse?! 
Oh no you don't! (Jumps in air and goes ghost.) You're not going to use the technology in this lab to take over the world! 
You know what? I've already been dumped on once in my own house. (Picks up Ghost Weasel nozzle.) And that's enough for one day! 
Great. It's the hottest party of the whole school year, and Paulina's going, and I'm not, again. 
Are you kidding? She's only, like, perfectly flawless. 
I'm...I'm invited! (Hugging invitation.) I've arrived! 
(Running out of Nasty Burger.) I will! 
Come on, Tuck. (Chuckling.) That's ridiculous. (Stops and pumps fist in air.) Kwan! Looking good! 
Huh? Uh, yeah! Oh, sure. I-I have two. That's how hip and high-end I am. 
Oh, man. (Looks at magazine.) This must cost a fortune! Where am I going to get the money by Saturday? 
(To Tucker:) Is crunk good? 
Crunk's good! (To Paulina:) Be right there! 
Hey, Dad, can you spare me some cash? I-I need to buy some clothes for Saturday. 
You mean, get a job? 
Saturday's another day. (Turns off light and closes door.) 
It's a perfectly good vacuum motor, Mr. Lancer. Only used once! (Mr. Lancer takes the motor.) Ten bucks. 
Yeah, well, he's been planning on getting rid of this junk for a long time. He won't even miss it, I hope. 
(Counting a stack of money.) I'm still twenty bucks short of what I need for those sweats. (Puts money in pocket.) 
Your place? Wow. You never invited us to your place before. 
Oh, sure do. (Picks up a computer part and software.) This motherboard and this Portals XL operating system will make it work like it's brand new! (Hands Dash the software.) Twenty bucks takes it all, and I'll even (Picks up upgrade disk.) throw in this upgrade disk. 
Twenty bucks! (Raises hands in the air.) I'm in! Oh, jeez. I better get to the mall before the shops close. (Goes back over to Sam and Tucker.) You guys don't mind cleaning up for me, do you? Great! See ya! (Runs off.) 
(Looking down at sweats.) Popularity, here I come. 
(Balancing himself.) Whoa! Whoa! I just got my hair the way I like it! On my head! 
And I'm way too young to shave! 
Going ghost! 
Okay, it's a haircut, not a head-cut! 
(Turning back into human form.) I know i should be concerned, (Getting back on scooter.) and I will be. Right after the party. (He rides off down the street.) 
Well, is it the bomb? Is it fresh? Is it stoopid, (Holding up two fingers.) with an "o-o?" 
Well, you'll change your tune when you see me at the party. (Notices Jazz is still in her normal clothes.) When are you changing? 
What? You're the only reason Dash invited me! 
(Suspiciously:) Uh, no, no! Not a thing, but... (Jack drops him.) we should compare notes (Walking out backwards.) once I get home from the party. Bye! 
Okay, this is it. Don't screw it up. Look out, world, here comes Danny Fenton! 
(Confused:) Uh, Dash? 
(Walking in.) Oh, swell. 
(About to protest.) Uh-- (Sighs.) 
Hi, I'm Danny. Do you guys-- 
Hey, aren't you in my fifth period? 
What am I doing? These people aren't my friends, even if they all look like them. Man, I wish Tucker and Sam were here. It's lonely being popular. 
That's odd. 
(Notices the upgrade disk on Dash's bed.) The upgrade! Dash still hasn't upgraded the software! (To Technus:) Oh, no! (Going ghost.) You're not getting that upgrade disk and making yourself more powerful! 
Ghost toast? Jeez, how many letter jackets does one guy need? And these-- (Picks up a bear.) --I don't even wanna know. 
(Dazed:) Hi, Sam. Hi, Tuck. Glad you could make it. 
Guys? Help! 
Come on, guys! (Flies up and gets knocked down.) Guys, come on, seriously! (Flies back up again. While dodging Technus's attacks:) I'm sorry I chose hanging with the popular kids over you guys. It was stupid and shallow and I'll never do it again! 
(Stands up.) He's running an old version of Portals XL. 
That, I can do. (Flies up to Technus.) Get back, you hunk of my dad's junk! 
(Grabbing the remote.) Give me that! 
Tucker, any time! 
(Being slammed into the wall. Grunts.) Guys? 
What's happening? 
Yes! (Flies up and grabs the end of the claw.) Process this! 
Not really. I hauled it all back to the shed yesterday while they were out. My dad's checking every piece for government surveillance devices. 
Well, I do have to return those stupid sweats so I can refund everybody's money. (Stops walking.) And I still feel terrible about the way I treated you guys. Of all people, I should know how it feels to be invisible. 
Yep. That one person's trash, is another person's revenge. 
So, why exactly are we breaking our backs here, Sam? 
Oh great. Him again. 
You guys get to the assembly. (Sam and Tucker run off.) I'll get this moron sealed up tight. 
(Feeling his chest.) Huh. Maybe Sam has a point. 
Oops. 
Yeah, and now because that idiot Box Ghost trashed my locker, I've been assigned a new one. (Reads paper.) Locker...seven-two-four. 
Guys, what's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost. (Chuckles.) Or something really scary that we don't see every single day. 
What's the big deal with 724? 
(Falls out of locker and stands up.) I'll show you cursed. Cover me. 
Oh, uh, hehe. Uh, no big deal, really. Uh, nothing for you and Mom to get obsessive about. 
Nice defense, Jazz. Total confidence-builder. 
It wasn't me, I swear! 
Now that was me. 
Sidney who-dexter? 
Sam, what are you doing? 
(Sighs.) You're right, Sam. I-- 
That's it! (Takes bread off of head.) 
Or twelve. In his pants. (Looks at box of frogs.) 
(Notices Poindexter floating next to him.) Huh? What? You can see me? 
(Turns fully visible.) What? Oh. (Laughs.) Oh, man. That's good. Man, do you ever have it backwards. 
(Points at his feet.) Uh, floating. 
Look, you don't understand. 
The what-a? 
No! Look! Just listen! I-I took over Dash's body because-- 
Hey! What are you doing?! 
Listen to me! Dash-- isn't-- 
Where am I? It's like I dropped into Grandpa Fenton's yearbook. 
I got to get out of here! 
This is how I came in. (Opens locker.) There's got to be a way back! 
(In the mirror:) Huh? 
What the heck?! (Sam and Tucker walk by the locker.) Tucker! Sam! It's me, Danny! 
I...give up. 
Have to contact them somehow. 
(From inside the mirror:) Sam! Tucker! In here! 
No! It's me, Danny! Poindexter took over my body and sent me into this bizarro spirit world. 
In second grade, Tucker threw up in your lunch box, but he told you Ricky Marsh did it. 
(Trying to get through the mirror.) The mirror acts as some kind of portal, but I can't phase through it. (Sighs in defeat.) Serves me right. I'm only in here because I was acting like a bully. Now I'm in here and I'm gonna get bullied for the rest of eternity! 
(Thinks and gets an idea.) I know how to get him in here. Here's what you need to do. 
You've had your fun. Now I want my body and my life back. 
You may have my powers, but you sure don't know how to use them. 'Course, I don't know how to use them, but at least I know how not to use them better than you do. 
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses. (Ducks as Poindexter tries to hit him.) You couldn't hit a guy with glasses. (Ducks another hit.) In fact, you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn! 
I'm not a bully! 
One false move, and I smash your door back to my world. 
(Lowers mirror.) Try me. 
That's what I was hoping you'd do. 
Because I used my powers for the wrong reason and became exactly the kind of person I hate. It got me into a load of trouble, and I'm not gonna do that again. 
(Takes mirror out of locker.) Just one more thing to do. 
I can explain! (Hesitates.) Actually, I really can't. 
(Sighs.) My fifteen minutes of popularity is up, and I wasn't even here for it. 
Now there's a guy who knows exactly who he is. 
Two for me, two for you? 
(Looks around to make sure no one's watching.) I'm going ghost! (Goes ghost.) 
None of your business, Candy Pants. 
(Backing away.) Hey, get away! 
(Looking at his glowing hand.) What the heck? What's going on? Is this...a new ghost power? 
(Looks at his hand.) I guess. 
(Sarcastically:) Fill in for the mascot. It'll be fun. You'll meet cheerleaders. 
Huh? 
Oh no! 
And getting beastier. 
I think he's running on ghost power. I need your help! 
Sort of. (Eyes flash green.) 
Whoa! (Holds nose.) Ghost energy's pretty strong. But hopefully, ripe for the picking. 
(Opens and holds out a Fenton Thermos, sucking in the ghost.) Back to the Ghost Zone for you, pal. 
End of the line, gruesome. 
Am I interrupting something, that I hope I'm not? 
You might just have a cold, you know. It doesn't have to be a ghost cold. 
(Pulls hand out quickly and holds it.) Whoa! This one actually works -- a little too well. I'm filing this under "Must Avoid." 
(On phone, split-screen:) Hang in there, Sam. Tucker and I are gonna come visit you when we're done at the mall. You want us to bring you anything? 
She's gotta be sick if she's missing Dead Teacher IV. (Phases through a trashcan.) 
Paulina? 
Tucker, I-- 
(Sticks hand out, charging up ecto-blast.) Bye-bye, kitty. 
Cool. It worked! I can't wait to tell Tucker. (Phases out through ceiling.) 
Huh, no Tuck. Eh, he must've taken off. (Walks away.) 
Jeez, lady, don't you ever take a break? (Sees the flying car.) Flying car? 
Hey, slow down, Jeff Gordon! You're going over the speed limit. (Looks to the side.) And the height limit. 
Tucker?! 
(Phases head through backseat.) Tucker Phantom? (Phasing body through seat.) Okay, ignoring the total originality of that, (Sits down) how the heck did you get ghost powers anyway? 
(Grabs steering wheel as well.) Tucker, we're too young to drive! 
Let go of the wheel! This is serious! 
Uh, yeah, because a car smashing into the twenty-eighth floor of anything is bad! 
When have I ever grabbed the spotlight? 
(Phases out of the grain.) Tucker, please. This is stupid. (Tucker phases out of grain.) You're my best friend. I'm not jealous. I'm concerned. 
(Reaches arm out.) Tuck, wait! 
Whoa! I can't fly that fast. Is he getting more powerful? 
Nice trick. Do you do kids' parties? 
I may be catching Sam's cold, but that's not important right now. Tucker, look. 
I was afraid of that. (Puts hand on Tucker's shoulder.) I hate to do this, pal, but I need to see what's going on inside of you, and there's only one way to do that. 
Got it. 
Oh no. 
Tucker, get out of there. 
Fine! I will! 
(Overshadowing Paulina) Tucker, you're turning the whole school upside-down. How 'bout giving it a break? 
(Turns Paulina around, eyes glow green. Points.) Because your fun is kind of mean. (Jerks thumb over shoulder.) Now get out of Paulina! 
(Turns Paulina around, eyes glow green.) No, you! 
Then maybe I need to have a chat with this Babazita. (Flies off.) 
If you're trying to snag a wishing ghost, what better place than a wishing well? 
Dang it. (Sneezes.) 
Huh? 
Oh, no you don't. 
Listen, Desiree, I want you to take away Tucker's ghost powers, pronto. 
Tuck? He's not that jealous. Is he? 
You change him back! 
Yeah? How 'bout a fist? 
Get back! 
(Struggling.) Aah! Can't break free! Can't go intangible and escape! (Suddenly spots the thermos lying a few feet from his head.) 
Or I do. (Grabs the thermos, uncaps it, and points it at Desiree.) I wish you would disappear inside this thermos! 
If I weren't a "C" student, I would've thought of that five days ago. Now to find Tuck. (Flies off.) 
Quarter to noon, and no sign of Tucker. 
Should've guessed. 
Tucker, you're changing your grades?! That's cheating! 
No way. Tucker, you're in real danger. (Reaches a hand out towards Tucker.) 
(Puts hands up defensively.) Take it easy. We're friends, remember? 
He's getting more malevolent. More ghost-like. 
(Stands.) Tuck, please! You have to listen to me. There isn't much time! 
Unfortunately, yes. I can't get through to him! (Pauses while getting an idea. Smiles.) But I know what can. (Jumps out to float in front of the table.) Catch me if you can, Sucker Phantom! 
The girls' locker room. 
Only five minutes left. (To Tucker:) Ha! You got no game! 
What's the matter? Can't catch what you can't see? 
Where is he? He has to have followed me. (Looks behind him.) It's almost noon! 
(In fake acting tone:) No! Don't throw me into the Ghost Zone. Please! 
I'm only gonna have one shot at this. 
No, it's not you, Tuck. Not anymore. 
Dude, don't worry about it. (Sniffs.) You were under the genie's spell, and you broke it. 
Or if I had been a little less of a show-off around you. (Sticks hand out.) Friends? 
(Smiling.) You don't know the half of it. 
Finally. One day where I get home on time without any ghost detours making me miss my ten o'clock curfew. 
Or not. Going ghost! 
You fellas look lost. Um, any chance of you staying that way? 
Ask me what? 
Dad? 
Give it your best shot, guys! I'm a whiz at dodgeball! 
Okay, technically it's "dodge-beak," but who cares? 
(Gasps.) Agh. It's almost ten! 
You know that old saying about a bird in the hand? (Spins vulture around and hits other two with him, then throws him towards them.) Well, neither do I! (Vultures fly away.) And don't go messing any windshields on your way out of town! 
I wonder why those guys were trying to waste Dad. (Clock chimes ten behind him. He flinches and turns to look at it.) Oh, no. Dad. 
(Frowning.) Oh, poop. 
You already said chores. 
Look, I'm under a lot of pressure. You two have no idea what it's like to be a kid today! 
Yeah? Well, I beg to differ. 
(Annoyed:) Jazz! 
(More annoyed:) Jazz! 
I...can? 
Ugh. I need some air. (Goes to press a button.) 
Jazz, hello? Football helmets, jerseys, cheeseheads? He's a Packers fanatic. 
(To Jazz:) Is he hitting on Mom? 
Whoa, cool! 
(Sliding hand through air.) Smooth. 
Oh, great. Just what I need: a working vacation. 
Hi, guys! (Punching a fist into his palm.) Remember me? 
Okay. That was almost too easy. 
Oh, whatever. I was aiming for the birds, but you'll do. 
Whoa. Fast. Alright, better stop fooling around. 
You...you know me? 
I...I don't wanna fight you. 
(Flies up and fires ecto-blast at Vlad.) Get away! 
No, I can't! How are you doing all this? 
No! Get away! 
Huh? Where am I? What happened? 
I...must've been worn out from the long car trip. I-I'll be okay in the morning. I'm sorry for the scare. 
Jazz, aren't you coming to the reunion? 
Whatever. (Leaves.) 
Okay, I'm officially mortified. 
Oh, sure, Mr. Masters. But call me Danny. "Son's" what my dad calls me. 
(Gets up.) Okay! 
Present? I don't see a present. 
Hey! Wait a minute. 
Oh, no. (Backing up.) No way. 
(Kicking one ectopus away.) Let go! 
Those ghosts... They were two of the first ghosts I fought! 
Skulker?! 
How did you get back in your ecto-skeleton? What are you doing here? 
Huh? Hey! I can't phase out of this. It's disrupting my powers! 
(Chuckles nervously.) Uh, the glowing blade is new. 
Skulker? The ectopuses? I don't understand! 
Second? 
You! I'm going ghost! (Nothing happens.) Going ghost! (Nothing happens again.) Why can't I go ghost? 
Let me out of here! 
Dude, you are one seriously crazed-up fruit loop. That is never going to happen. 
(Relieved:) Hey, you're the Dairy King! (Worried again:) Oh, great. What are you gonna do? Suffocate me with Limburger? Strangle me with Swiss?! Or-- 
Let me go? (Kicks cube out of the way.) Well, thank you! But, why? 
Hey, will you help me fight Plasmius? 
(Alarmed:) Dad! (Goes ghost and flies off.) 
Guess again, cheesehead. 
Forget it, pal. Your money can't buy my mom, it can't buy the Packers, and it can't buy me! 
(Pointing.) I know who you are. I'll tell my father. I'll tell everyone. 
Huh? 
Oh, great. It's a stick. 
Sorry, dad. I've got one shot at this. 
(Overshadowing Jack) It was nothing, Mom-- uh, Maddie. Sure, heh, Maddie. You make sure Harry's okay (Sets Maddie down) while I finish this. 
How's it going, V-Man? 
Listen to me. I swear I'll walk out of my dad right now and expose us both, unless you agree to a truce. 
(Lowers Vlad a bit.) No, I'm not. My parents will accept me, no matter what. But if I expose you...well, what would my mom think of you? 
You'll be miserable and alone for the rest of your life, unless you call a truce. 
I can't believe they fired Harry. 
Oh, whatever. Who cares what you were when you were younger? It's who you grew into that makes you who you are. 
Hey, if you can cause that much damage in college, and still turn out to be this cool, ghost-butt-kicking adult, well, maybe there's hope for me yet. 
Oh, man! 
Dad, can I ask you a question? 
Huh? (The Speeder begins to fly forward.) Whoa! 
Whoa! (Closes eyes in anticipation of impact.) 
Whooooooooa! 
Uh, sorry. (Shakes.) I-I didn't know. I'm from...out of town. 
Y-Yes, sir. (Salutes and smiles nervously.) 
Divorce? What?! (Looks at Jazz walking out door past him.) Jazz, did you just hear that? 
Yeah, but I-I have never heard her so mad. 
Jazz? Are Mom and Dad gonna split up? 
Jazz? (Pokes Jazz.) Jazz?! 
Hey! I'm trying to make this place spotless so Mom will have a clean house to come home to. 
Oh, my gosh. This place is a mess! (Floats down a bit.) If Mom comes back and sees the lab like this, she'll be even angrier at Dad. 
"Let this gift repair the bridge to our love. Happy anniversary - Jack?!" (Stares at portal.) Oh, no. 
You should've seen 'em fighting. My folks never fight. Well, they fight ghosts, but...that's different. 
But it's the thing my dad's gonna use to apologize! They're...right on the brink! I'm telling ya, anything could set them over the edge. 
Said the word. (Stops walking.) Oh, man. She did! (Screaming:) She said the word! 
That settles it. I'm going into the Ghost Zone and get that present back. 
(Sighs.) I so don't want to do this. 
(To Sam:) You'll monitor the webcam? 
No, it's not. It's creepy. And it goes on forever. I don't even know where to start to look! 
Uh-, (raises arm) -Hi! (weak chuckle) 
Have-have you seen a (moves arms) present? (Eyes shift to the top-right corner) Um, about (moves arms again to show size) about yea big? 
Sorry, (eyes get wider) Sorry! Wah! 
Oh, man. 
Every one of these doors goes into another ghost’s lair?! I’m never gonna find that present. My folks are gonna get divorced and it’s gonna be all my fault. 
Huh. 
So *this* is where all that stuff ends up. 
Ugh, what are *you* doing here? 
You mean the Fenton Thermos? 
Ugh. Look, I’m looking for something important, (lifts arms) I don’t have time for your box puns. 
Hey, what’s going on? 
Wait! This is all a big misunderstanding! 
Great. My folks are splitting up, my sister’s a basket case, (turns to face the Box Ghost) and I’m going to ghost jail. 
This may be the worst day of my life. 
This is the worst day of my life. 
[Turning around, closing his eyes and yelling.] Will you stop that! 
Excuse me, sir, but-but- 
Uh, you said “executioner” three times. 
[Turns to Walker.] Well, you see, uh, Mr. Walker, uh, the truth is— [He grabs his chair.] —I-I’m actually trying [Danny walks off with the chair.] to remove— [Zoom out to show Danny walking with his chair to get closer to the present, Walker is turned the other way on the other side.] —the contraband. So, um, if I could just [Zoom in on Danny.] grab it and go, [Chuckles nervously and stands up to grab the present.] I’ll promise I’ll— 
[Weak chuckle.] Wow, heh, pretty much everyone who hates me all at one table. [Close up on Danny’s face.] Just like high school. [Cut to the table. Everyone stands up and walks toward Danny, Technus is grasping his fist in his hand. Cut to an aerial view, the four of Danny’s foes have him partially surrounded on the front side, with Technus on Danny’s left, then Desiree, then The Box Ghost, then Skulker on the right.] Sorry I can’t stay and catch up on old times! [Danny walks backwards. Cut to Danny bumping into the food line. He turns around.] 
[Thrusts his arm forward.] Wait! [His arm retracts back to the ladle.] I’m not the enemy here. I mean, yeah, [He bends his arms out.] I sent you all back to the Ghost Zone, [He turns his arms to the right, the Lunch Lady, struggles to keep Danny in place.] but I didn't lock you up here, did I? 
If we work together we could all bust out of here. [Zoom out to show Skulker from behind, with Danny in a headlock by the Lunch Lady's ladle in the distance.] And you could always [Outstretches his arms.] kick my butt later. 
Here’s what we do... 
[Getting up.] Ohhh... [Close up on Danny’s face.] My ghost leg! 
Now! 
No thanks, [Close up on Danny’s face.] I have some unfinished business with the warden. 
Thanks. [Expression changes from happy to confused.] I think? 
How about saying [Close up on Danny’s face.] “please”? [Zoom out. Walker is in the foreground shown from behind.] Saying “please” is a rule. 
Is now. [Close up on Danny’s face. He blinks and looks to the left. Cut to the present. It is still floating and glowing in place. Zoom in on it. Cut to Danny.] The present! 
Tucker, Sam! How’d you get in here? 
[Repeats.] We’re the ghosts? [Close up on Danny’s face.] So... maybe it’s time to stop fighting like a ghost... [Zoom out. Aerial shot. Walker is shown from behind, standing on Danny, whose hands are still on the boot and whose legs have spread out. Danny smirks.] And start fighting like a kid! 
I’ll take that! 
Forget it, Walker. This is the Ghost Zone, I’m not just a ghost— [Cut to Danny seen from behind. Walker is in the foreground. Pan up to show the Specter Speeder.] —I’m human. Your rules— [Cut to Danny. He puts the present under one arm and grabs the back of the Specter Speeder with the other.] —don’t apply. 
[Off-screen.] No he didn’t! 
H-He kept it at home— [Jack’s face is now in the foreground. Cut to Jack, who is holding out his arms. Danny walks onscreen, handing the box to Jack.] —uh, so the mosquitoes wouldn’t get it? [Danny holds out his arms at his shoulders. Jack crouches over to Danny, holding the box.] 
I have an allowance? 
You guys aren’t getting a divorce? [Puts his arms down.] 
They weren’t ever gonna [Holds his arm out.] get a divorce! 
It was all just a huge misunderstanding. 
Love some. 
[to himself] Good one, Fenton. You let him get away, you idiot. 
Yeah, well, your brother calls you fink! 
Yeah, when I was 8 and you weren't a fink. 
I can't believe my stupid sister convinced Lancer to make this my punishment. And can we please turn up the heat in here? I can see my own breath! 
What?! 
Wait, Jazz called me a loser too? 
Then why do I feel so miserable? 
I'm fine. I can't believe my sister told that shrink I'm a loser. 
[sarcastically] Wow, you are the smart one. [scowls again] 
[interrupting] Jazz, I know you think you're helping, and I'm sure when I'm older I'll appreciate it, but right now, I don't. 
Well, maybe this is me now, huh? Not everyone's pumped up full of spirit all the time, you know. [His ghost sense goes off.] [to himself] Ghost sense? I don't see anything. [He starts shivering.] 
Leave me alone! 
Back off, ghost bug! 
Somebody called for an exterminator? 
I should have gone intangible. Idiot! I'm not getting better at this. I'm getting worse. 
Alright, pal! Time for you to-- [he looks around. Bertrand has vanished.] Gone. Great. Another bad guy gets away. [He flies up off the ground. We see Jazz watching through a window as Danny hovers in front of it, his back to her.] Maybe Jazz was right. Maybe I am a loser. 
It didn't look like a ghost to me. It just looked like a big bug. So I ran. [bitterly] Like a looooser. 
Nope. 
What? Jazz, no! 
[visibly grasping for something to say] I...I... [more enthusiastically] ...actually, yes. Jazz thinks she saw a ghost today. [grinning smugly] Tell them, Jazz. 
Well, enjoy your chat! 
A month's detention?! But I didn't do anything! 
But-- 
And this is supposed to help me how? 
[sitting down] I'm not afraid of being called a baby. I'm afraid of...being called a loser. 
[resignedly] Of course. 
Hey, whose side are you on, anyway? 
Ah-- Yeah, I know. [He drops his head into his arms on the table.] I don't get it. [Sitting up again slightly] Why am I so depressed and angry all the time? That shrink was supposed to be helping me. Ever since I started talking to her, I've been feeling worse. 
[crossly] Like you care. Just go away, Jazz. [His ghost sense goes off.] Oh, no. 
[to himself] Gotta keep Jazz busy. [Popping to his feet, he glares accusingly at Tucker and Sam.] Yeah, well, if you're gonna take her side, then you hang with her too! [Grabbing Jazz by the shoulder and shoving her into his chair] Here, take my seat, [throwing his arm melodramatically over his face] you've already taken my friends. [He races off through the back door of the pharmacy.] 
I know you need your makeup, but you're just gonna have to wait your turn. 
[Getting back up] Yeah, well, maybe I don't need to be to beat you! 
Then again-- 
No! You leave them alone! 
[So mad his eye twitches] Do...not..call..me...a LOSER!!! 
[dejected] Great, he got away again. Another ringing endorsement for the town screw-up. 
[noticing her staring at him] What? 
[Flinching] Ugh! What?! 
Yeah right. That's not what I hear. 
I know. 
[Looking away, like he's seriously considering it] Um... 
I don't feel like talking about it. [walks away and crosses his arms sulkily] 
Oh, gross! 
And to make it worse, we're all gonna have to sit through Jazz's idiotic speech when she tries to put the "I" back in "spirit" or some other nonsense. 
What the heck is she so happy about? 
[perking up] Wait a minute. [grabbing Tucker's PDA] Let me see something. [He opens one of the pictures of himself in the baby suit.] 
Glad you didn't. Look at that. [In the photo, Danny's breath is clearly visible.] I kept thinking I was seeing my breath. [He zooms in closer] That it was cold. But what if that's my ghost sense? What if Spectra is somehow making people more miserable? What if she's a ghost? 
Jazz! 
I figured it out, finally. You feed on misery, don't you? 
No, I'm sure you can't. You can't help anyone except yourself. 
You find that one thing that a kid's most afraid of [Spectra listens in amusement] -- their future, their looks, their confidence -- [he falters slightly, then puffs out his chest] and you pick at it and pick at it while your snippy little ghost assistant feeds on it! 
Let go of me! 
Man, I am so tired of you dumping on me. And I am so tired of dumping on myself. Jazz never did that, even when I was mad at her. [throwing off Spectra] And I won't let her down! 
I so don't have time for this. [Pulling the Thermos off his back, he uncaps it and sucks up Bertrand.] 
And you're done telling me what to do! [Flying around behind her, he grabs Spectra by the tail and throws her into a nearby Dumpster. He smiles triumphantly for a moment, then realizes what he's forgotten.] Jazz! 
Both! Uh...neither! I don't know. 
Talk about having nothing within. 
Uh...uh... 
Oh. Uh, right. [Going intangible, he flies off.] 
Aaaaaaah! 
*huff* Moving *puff* Gotta keep moving [He looks behind him] 
Every time he fails, he comes after me! 
Wait a minute! I have ghost Powers. 
Man, that was close. 
It's like Dash, but with better breath. Now this I can handle. 
Or not. 
[to Valerie] I'll tell you what I'm not: Coated with dog saliva. 
Bad dog! No! Get back here! 
Cut it out, you stupid mutt! 
I feel bad. If I could have stopped that ghost dog, none of this would have happened. 
Hey, come on. I know you're upset. But he just wants to help. We all do. 
[Ghost sense goes off] I'm gonna have to pass too. [Danny hops on his scooter and rides out of sight.] 
How'd you get out of the Ghost Zone? [Tickles Cujo under the chin, and he turns into his small, cute, happy form.] 
Ghost dogs are more entertaining than regular dogs. [Lifts one foot and examines it.] Great. Invisible dog do. 
Come on, boy! Not again! 
Okay, Cujo! In you go! [Tosses Cujo through the portal.] 
[hands covered with green ghost dog saliva] Yuck! That's it, I'm getting a hamster. 
Did you see that? Valerie just got scorched by her friends. 
No kidding. Hey, who let the dogs in! 
You see, the song is “Who let the dogs out” but I said " Who let the dogs in.” [pause] I'll be right back. [ducks under the table to go ghost] 
Nice pooch! Easy. That lady isn't edible. And neither is anything she cooks. 
And neither am I! 
I'm telling you this is one bad dog. Every time I throw him into the ghost zone, he tunnels out through the portal and comes looking for me. 
Where are you going? 
Okay, let's get to it. [reads aloud] "A dog's hearing is much more acute than a human's.“ Which means...” 
That's weird! This dog is already trained. [Cujo jumps up to lick his face, knocking him down the small hill.] Sort of. 
Stay!  
What the heck was that?! 
Wow. Nice aim. [pink buzz-saw blade comes down, nicking Danny's arm.] Hey! That hurt! 
Don't know. Don't care. See the ball boy? [Makes an energy ball.] Fetch! 
Oh, man! She's coming! Sam! Hide! 
[snapping coming out of a happy daze] No! Why?! D-did you? 
Great! My best friend has a crush on a ghost hunter. 
How can I? That stupid ghost dog could be anywhere, not to mention, I have no idea how Valerie became a ghost hunter. 
Really? What else did he tell you? 
Looking for something? What are you looking for? Sam was right. Ghost dog or not, you're still a dog, and You're looking for something. 
You should be safe here until help comes. 
Tucker, you can't still like her! 
You I trust. It's your hormones I worry about. 
379 girls at our school, and you've got to have a crush on the one with the weapons and the grudge. 
All this is my fault. I suppose I should do something to help Valerie. After I figure out what to do with you. 
Go on boy, go get it! 
How d... [pointing] FETCH! 
What you're looking for is in there? Somebody's coming! 
[After Damon and the Axion boss have passed] Valerie's dad? Oh, great! 
Okay. Good news, there's only one guard. Bad news, it's Valerie's dad. 
[going ghost] So I think it's safer if I go down there by myself. This Fenton Fisher should make a good leash. [uses the ghost fishing line to tie Cujo's collar to a tree.] You guys watch the dog. 
[Flying slowly] I wish I knew what I was looking for. 
I really hate to do this! [charges up a ghost energy ball] But [releases a blast that knocks away Valerie's gun.] 
That's because I'm not trying to hit you. Can't we talk? 
Yeah, you're welcome! [lets her drop] 
An old kennel? This must be where they kept all the guard dogs. 
Huh? 
Keep away! Is this what you've been looking for? [Holds up a little pink bear, the squeaky toy he found in the kennel.] 
It's OK! Duz you want your squeaky? Oh, Duz you? Here you go! [Throws the toy like a ball.] Now, please, go home! And stay there! 
Look, I know you're angry, and but it's not my dog, and I'm sorry about whatever to you, but not all ghosts are evil. 
I'm sorry, but I can't help you there! [flies off] 
I just with I knew where she got those weapons. 
Get off me, Klemper! 
Will someone please remind me- [Klemper pulls Danny into a hug.] Why- [Cut to Sam holding her hair back so she can admire her earphone, which Danny’s voice is coming out of.] This was a good idea? [Sam lowers her hand.] 
They’re not supposed to look good. [Strains. Zoom out and rotate to reveal Klemper hugging him tightly. Danny has his hands pushing Klemper’s head and his feet are wiggling wildly.] They’re supposed to filter out spectral noise so [Places feet on Klemper’s chest trying to pull his hand away. Klemper, concerned, doesn’t want to let go.] we can communicate. [Danny is flung backwards. Pan left as he lands on his back with Klemper on top of him. Danny tries to push him up.] Like when I say things like [Shouts as Klemper wiggles his tiny legs.] HELP GET THIS THING OFF ME! 
Really? [Smiles.] Hey, maybe I should give a pair to Paulina. [Klemper shoves a hand over Danny’s mouth, silencing him.] 
Can a ghost get frostbite? 
Uh… [Sam and Danny release their hands suddenly, with Danny narrowing his eyes in a weak smile.] 
I think I’m gonna need my hands [Puts his hands on his ears.] for this. 
I don’t get it! [Looks at Tucker’s shirt.] This Ember McLain comes outta nowhere [Cut to Danny.] and suddenly she’s the biggest thing since MP3s! [Arches his eyebrows.] It’s so-- [Sam, from off-screen, interrupts him. Danny looks disappointed.] 
I was gonna say “weird”, but, uh, [Shrugs, smiling.] okay. 
We’re not together. 
Uh-oh. 
[Off-screen.] Ember’s [Cut to Danny, mystified.] the ghost? [Cut to a shocked Danny, bending down.] Oh my gosh! 
[Bends down.] I gotta save Lancer! [Close-up on Danny. He asides.] Wow, this is bittersweet. 
Now to knock the pop princess [Turns his head forward.] off the [Stops suddenly.] 
[Off-screen.] -charts? 
Tucker, you’re starting to scare me. And I fight ghosts! 
You know, he has a point. 
I still don't get [He places his hands on his locker and turns it intangible.] why we're not affected by Ember's music. [Danny plunges his hand inside as if he's searching for something. Sam shrugs.] 
Individuality or [He takes the Fenton Thermos out of his locker, resuming color in his arm as he points up with his other hand.] intelligence?  
Are you okay, Sam? [Cut to Sam, suddenly looking nervous and awkward.] 
Something tells me they’re not gonna love seeing their idol sucked inside [Looks to Sam.] the Fenton Thermos. 
Hey! Do you take requests? [Close-up on Danny.] How about “Beat It”? 
“Dipstick”? [Smiles falsely.] Ho ho. [Returns to serious.] Funny. [He flies off.] 
Who writes your insults? [Cut to Danny.] The same hack who writes your songs? [He looks down to the side.] 
Chanting… [Blinks, looking to Ember.] makes her stronger… 
[Dreamily.] Wow. I just never realized [Cut to Danny crawling toward Sam at the edge of the cutout over flowing traffic below. Horns honk.] you’re really pretty [Stops crawling.] when you’re about to fall off a building. 
But you’re over there [He lowers his eyes dreamily as he puts his palm near his chest.] and I’m over here. I wanna be [Points.] over there! 
[Crawling forward dreamily.] Who’s Paulina? 
How can I study? [Closes his eyes.] All I can think about is Sam. 
[Meditating..] Sam… 
[Off-screen.] Sam… 
Sam! You snuck out to see me! [He hunches his shoulders and closes his eyes dreamily.] Oh, this is just like Romeo and Juliet [The sparkles stop as Danny points a thumb to his chest.] except I’m the one on the balcony [He smiles gleefully and shrugs as the sparkles resume.] and I can understand everything we’re saying. 
You want me to open up? [Cut to Danny leaning as he looks onto the floor.] Okay. [He puts a finger on his face to think.] Um, one time, [Puts out his hand.] when I was five, [Clasps his hands together dreamily.] I really wanted a puppy, [Points up a finger in a mimicking lecture.] but my parents- 
It doesn’t matter! [Danny takes Sam’s hands and admires her with green sparkles flaring up everywhere.] Just so long as we have each other. 
So why are you still holding my hands? 
And why are you still wearing those [Close-up on Danny.] Fenton Phones I gave you? 
[Sparkles clear.] Does this mean that we’re breaking up? 
So we’re not breaking up? 
You’re beautiful when you’re wracked with guilt. 
I won’t leave you, Sam. 
I can’t! [Close-up on Danny.] I won’t! 
Sam [Close-up on Danny.] how could you? [Closes his eyes angrily.] How? [Zoom out to show Danny yelling.] Hey, get away from her! 
You and Dash? [Points to Sam, smiling.] But we were [Close up on shocked and worried Sam, blinking. Close up on smiling Danny, who looks down again. Cut to Sam and Danny again.] But… we weren’t, [Danny drops his hand, Sam looks down.] were we? 
[Growling.] Ember… 
No. I feel like my heart’s been ripped out. [Close-up on Danny.] But I know who I can take it out on! 
Hey, No-Hit wonder! Mind if I jam with the band? 
[Off-screen.] Sorry! [Cut to Danny holding the microphone stand in both hands.] No vocals in this number! [Close-up on Danny.] Have you considered taking up mime? 
She’s too strong. If I could just stop the crowd from chanting. [Cut to the crowd pumping their hands in the air. Pan across it to the right. Off-screen.] Something horrible that will break the spell [Close-up on Danny, looking back.] Like… [Cut to Danny. Pan left as he turns back to Sam and Tucker backstage.] Sam kissing Dash! [Cut to Tucker with his dreamy smile. Zoom in on him. Cut to Danny. He’s smirking and holding a microphone.] Or worse. [Zoom out as Danny prepares to chuck the microphone.] Tucker, sing! Take the mic and sing! [He chucks it. Cut to Tucker, his arms out to catch it. He holds it, unsure.] 
Oh, uh, [Laughs and shrugs.] I-I was kidding! [Points his fingers.] You rock! [Lifts his arms.] You rock out loud! 
The only thing we’re saying here is [Thrusts out the thermos as it charges up blue.] goodbye! [The thermos blasts a blue capture beam.] 
Uh, o-okay, [Turns and raises a palm.] y-you can stop now. 
Nope. Besides, [Leans his head back.] she’s a little busy right now. 
I know what you mean. Nobody but us has a clue. Except for that Chaos guy. That guy is unstoppable. 
Still not stopped. 
What? 
Darn it. I thought using the Fenton Helmet as my game controller would give me an edge, not hat hair. 
Oh no you don't. (Goes ghost) At least the hair's better. 
Oh great. Constantly getting zapped in Doomed is bad enough but now I have to track down that loser. Or I can deal with it tomorrow. It is tomorrow. I've been up all night. (Yawns) Oh well, one sleepy day at school and one lame ghost freed. What's the worst that could happen? 
Last time Technus fused a monster out of the junk from my dad's shed. Be on the lookout for runaway appliances. 
Uh level zero is a no man's land, Sam. It's a glitch in the Doomed program. If you get knocked into it, you're stuck there. 
Look familiar? Technus saw me playing Doomed last night and now he's trying to look like Chaos. 
Ignoring that. Okay Tuck here's what we'll do. You distract him with an L2 throttle right maneuver and I'll power up and engage him in battle mode. 
You stay here, Sam. You probably don't know the moves that we're talking about here. 
Okay. This calls for advance mode with an intangibility bonus. 
Cool. How'd I do that? 
Yeah well you Technus, are going to need to learn some new video game moves if you want to beat us. 
Eh, whatever. I'm here, he's gone, and that means my work here is done. 
Okay Tuck, just like in the park. 
Aw man. It's like he was three steps ahead of us. Uhh another all-nighter. (Yawns) 
M-Mr. Lancer. I-I can explain-- 
Pass me so you don't look bad? 
But it's only one stupid test. 
Got it. I got it! If you crack the safe at MegaMart you get an extra life. 
As much as I hate to say it, Sam's got a point. I probably should be studying. Tuck? 
Chaos is nothing compared to Lancer. Imagine if he caught me in here. 
But it's fun. 
Then you need to get out more. 
My parents?! 
Dad, I-- 
(Simultaneously with Jazz) But I have stuff to do after class. How do you know that? 
It's Tucker. 
I can't believe it was you dusting us all this time. Why didn't you say something? 
What a mess. It's my fault Technus is out there while I'm stuck studying the world's dullest subject. 
Uh, just stretching my legs. Oh, writing your sister, huh? You have a sister? 
I'm 14. I don't really care. 
Gotta cross teacher off my what I wanna be when I grow up list. You guys there? 
Just checking in. How's it going? 
Wish I could help. Studying is such a drag. 
Mr. Lancer, I was just taking the-- 
Here we go. Um, in the poem the Tyger. Why does he rhyme the words I and symmetry? 
And it's Blake, right? William Blake? 
Really? Which ones? 
Well, it's now or never. And it better be now. We've got less than an hour before Technus gets to the last level. 
Ninety one? Ninety one? I aced it? 
Yes! I knew I could do it. Hey, I did. I did know I could do it. Thanks. 
Don’t think this means you won't have to. I aced it! 
Hello. Not an idiot. Seeya. 
Yo guys I'm here. And I aced the test. 
No, I got an A minus. A solid A minus. 
It'll take me forever to reach level 13. 
Ghost powers? Ugh I'm such an idiot. Technus used his ghost powers in the game, so, why can't I right? Alright, I'm in. This had better work. Woah. Excellent. I'm learning all over the place today. Sweet. My powers are the ultimate cheat code. 
Master of long-winded introductions. Do you ever stop talking about yourself? 
Thanks. He's vulnerable. Keep hammering him. 
Negative. Incoming! 
Tucker! 
Um yeah. Could you take out the trash, Sam? 
Not bad for a girl. 
Level zero. It's a glitch in the program. One way in, no way out. 
Totally out of date. 
Just the most awesome display of gamesmanship ever. 
Huh? Who on Earth could have done that? 
You’re one slippery ghost eel, but I bet you don’t know this trick! 
Oookay. Maybe you do. 
Oof! 
Scary? [Lifts his hands.] Haunted house? [Clenches his hands into fists.] This is great! [Cut to another shot of Danny. Dash is standing behind him facing right but looking to the left at Danny.] I am going to [Crosses arms, while Dash turns and puts his arms on his hips.] totally kick his butt! 
Sure. [Zoom in on Danny.] If I win, [Looks down and rolls eyes back, trying to think of something.] you have to [Looks up.] run through the school parking lot in your underwear! 
What if we did something with… skeletons? [As he says this, he draws Dash being choked by the already drawn skeleton. Cut to an aerial shot of Danny’s room. Danny is sitting on his bed with legs crossed, Tucker is sitting to the right on a swivel chair with his arms on the back rest and his legs on either side of the support beam. Danny shows the sketchpad to Tucker.] See? H-How scary is that? 
How ‘bout this? 
Wheee-oooo… 
Oh, man! [With a flash of light near Danny’s chin, two rings appear as he turns back to a human.] Halloween’s a week away- 
And I still don’t have a [Raises his arms, looking up.] clue what I’m gonna do for my [Puts his right hand back on his chin and his left hand back on his knee.] haunted house room. 
“Chronicles of the Fright Knight”? 
Wait a minute… [Cut to a shot of Danny reading the book, he looks up in surprise.] I’ve seen this before! 
Look familiar? 
This is great! He’s a ghost, [Zoom in on Danny.] and he’s the spirit of Halloween? [Danny picks up the book and looks in it again.] That means I can take the best ideas from- 
This guy and fuse them [Close up.] into my haunted house room! 
Well, [He lifts his arms.] it’s not about being original, [He puts down his right arm and points with his left one.] it’s about not eating Dash’s underwear. 
[With a gruff voice.] I AM THE FRIGHT KNIGHT! TREMBLE BEFORE THE SOUL SHREDDER! 
[With a salesman tone.] It slices. [Danny bops the sword on Tucker’s head, causing the sword to squeak.] it dices, [Danny slams the end of the sword into Tucker’s stomach, and lifts it up, bonking it on Tucker’s head a couple more times.] it creates your worst fear! [Cut to another shot, this time looking up at the model while Danny thrusts the sword down near the camera, the sword jiggles. Still with a salesman tone.] Now, how much would ya pay? 
Mom? Dad? What are you doing? 
This is all very riveting, [Puts down his hand and looks down.] and by riveting I mean “Dull” with a capital “D”, [Looks up and points his thumb over his shoulder.] but you guys need to leave before Lancer thinks you’re helping me. 
No! No, no, no! [Danny walks to the left off-screen with his arms raised, Sam follows. Cut to the doorway, Danny is walking his parents to the door.] Um, I’m just starting to get interested in ghosts, [Thrusts out his arms.] like my old man! 
Decorated room, [Cut to Danny from the front, floating. He looks downward and points behind his shoulder with his thumb.] faked-out parents… 
Only thing left to do is to check out what Dash’s lame theme is [Crosses his arms and closes his eyes.] then spend the rest of the night gloating! 
Man, that is cool! [Danny looks down. Cut to his hands. The yellow sword is lying prone, and it deflates with a high-pitched hiss, falling over Danny’s wrists. Cut to another shot of Danny with the deflated sword.] And man, that’s not! I have to do something fast [Cut to a shot of Dash’s feral underpants in a glass case on a table. Nest to it is a blue placard that reads “Reserved for Fenton”.] or it’s Tighty-Whiteys [Zoom in on the underwear.] for dessert. 
Desperate times [Cut to a farther shot, Danny is about to enter through a window. His face faces front and turns to face the back as he enters.] call for desperate measures. 
Oh, right. [Danny removes his hand, revealing a small gash in his side and a pool of green, ectoplasmic goo on his glove. Zoom out to Danny.] Rule number one: [Thrusts back.] In the Ghost Zone, [Turns and clenches his fist.] ghosts can be hurt. 
Wait a minute! That’s right! 
Ghosts can be hurt here... 
...but humans have it made! 
This place gives me the creeps. 
Which means it’ll scare the pants offa Lancer! 
You guys need to eat more red meat. 
Hi-ya! 
Uh 
That’s right! 
You know badness when you see it. 
What? 
I-I can bring the sword back by midnight,-- 
(offscreen) *Yes*! 
Home sweet home! 
Phew 
If you think that’s scary,-- 
Stole, borrowed. 
Semantics 
You worry too much. 
Maybe I should get this thing back. 
Right after Mr. Lancer judges my room! Besides,-- 
That’s right, Sam. 
*Nothing* is safe inside… (bends over to pick up an object) Danny Fenton’s… (now carrying a functional flashlight and shines it in his face for a creepy effect) “Room of Doom”! 
Enter if you dare. 
(chuckles weakly, smiling, before turning back to the spider) All part of the show. 
(looks toward Sam, smiling as if he has control over the situation) I will, as soon as Lancer declares me the winner! 
Yes! (stands up straight, arms akimbo) I’ll take “mildly impressed”. 
That’s my cue to clean up! 
Sam! 
(off-screen) Catch! 
*See*? (leans back and crosses arms) I told ya I had everything under control. 
We’ve got enough-- 
*Tuck*! 
Hah! 
Lancer? 
Where’d he go? 
Mr. Lancer? 
What’d you do to him? 
*YES*! (crouches down with fists clenched, eyes closed and smiling with victory) This contest is SO MINE! 
Uh, (turns eyes forward) I mean-- 
(with pretend, proud superhero voice) Bring him back, you fiend! 
Not if I can help it! 
Which, *apparently* I can’t. 
Tucker! 
No! 
(within the crack) Doesn’t *anything* work on this guy? 
Sam 
I'm so sorry. 
I wanted to win so bad! 
But not *this* bad. 
A pumpkin? 
There are no pumpkins in the room. 
“No pumpkins in the room”? (relaxes shoulders) It’s Halloween! (puts hand to face) What am I, an idiot? 
Strike 6! Way to whip, Mr. October! 
Hah! 
“To cease the storm… 
To end the fear… 
(lifts the sword a little more, looking to the left) The sword must sheathe… 
In pumpkin near!” 
Trick *and* treat, buckethead! 
Told ya I’d have it back by midnight. 
Sam! 
Haha! 
Yes! 
Mr.Lancer?(runs off-screen) Wait up! 
Mr. Lancer, wait. (straightens up) I have to be honest. 
(looking to the right, eyelids hanging low) I-I cheated. 
Well I borrowed--eh--uh, (lifts the other hand, palm lying flat) -- stole, (brings the arms to his sides, they are still up) some of my parent’s technology. 
Yeah! That! 
You don’t know (slumps down, miserable) the half of it. 
Hey! Easy on the ghost Ink. I just had this Suit cleaned. 
Down, boy! Don't eat that; It's a vegetarian! 
What a night. Everytime I turn around, there's another ghost! 
Where are all these ghosts coming from?! 
Ugh come on. I've been fighting ghosts for 24 hours. Can't one be easy? 
So long slinky. 
Oh great. One more to go. 
Um sir. I believe you're speeding. 
Ugh. Of all the rotten luck. 
And because of some stupid shadow I had to spend another night rounding up the same ghosts again! 
No. But I think I know what is. 
Oh great. More bad luck. 
Jazz! 
Jazz are you alright? 
No. Shouldn't you? 
(simultaneously with Jazz) Her name's not Kitten. 
He's here? Oh man that can't be good. 
Well this is awkward. 
The weirdest part was me and my parents were actually on the same page. I'm not like them…am I? 
Darn it Jazz. 
Sufferin' spooks. "Sufferin' spooks"? Oh man I am becoming my dad! 
Ugh. Gotta break away from this thing. 
Okay. So bright light weakens it. I need some bright light. [Danny scans the town below and spots the movie theather.] Oh yeah. That'll do. 
Smile for the camera! 
I gotta do something. 
Hiya. Not interrupting anything, am I? 
Alright. Alright! I was spying on Jazz, and I'm really… 
Ugh this stinks. My sister's dating a ghost and I'm turning into my parents! 
What the heck are you turning into? 
Come on, you can't pull off goth. 
[Off-screen] She's not anybody's girl. 
No! I won't! Not any more than you would if it were me. [Danny walks up to Jazz and grabs her shoulders.] Come on Jazz. 
Think like the brain surgeon you keep telling us you're gonna be. Does this seem right? 
Don't you think I'm doing this because I have a reason. 
I don't know exactly what's going on, but I know you can't do it without this. Seeya Freakshow. 
Ugh. Tucker. Sam. Please pick up. 
Hello? Hello? Yeow. Nice hair. Lose a bet? 
(gasps) I need geek. 
Come on guys. 
Time for someone else to get a little dose of bad luck. Catch me if you can, Spooky. 
You want this stuff? You're going to have to be faster than that. 
Maybe I'm not trying to run. 
Hit it! 
Maybe I'm exactly where I wanted to be. 
Better luck next time. But next time, stay away from my sister. 
He's gone and he won't be coming back. 
Hey. 
Hey. 
I need a new image. Can I borrow your PDA? 
I'm gonna need a bigger thermos! [Tackled by a ghost] 
This is going to end badly. 
OK, who's the idiot security advisor that came up with those lame ideas? [His parents come in] 
Time to sit in the back where nobody can notice us? 
Oh no. You have got to be kidding me. Here? Now? 
[Ghost sense constantly goes off] There's so many ghosts in here, my ghost sense is going crazy. 
What are you getting at? [They walk into their house and look shocked] 
Um if you need me, I'll be in my room being so quiet, it's like I'm not even there. 
[Sarcastically] Why would I not be? Just because the town's on high alert and my parents are at my school? [Quickly chews his food then holds his throat] And I'm chewing so fast I think I just swallowed my spork. [Phases his arm through his stomach and pulls a spork out] There we go. All I know is as soon as I get five free minutes, I'm gonna toss that blabbering hairball that started this back into the ghost zone! 
Oh no. Here? Again? 
[To Sam and Tucker] If anybody asks where I am, lie. [Runs towards a tree] I'm going gho- [Sees Jazz behind the tree] 
Okay. Now I'm going ghost. [Transforms] 
Whoa! Portable ghost portal? Oh great. 
[About Wulf] You're big, you're hairy, and you're a ghost. But if Walker's goons are after you, you can't be all bad. [Zips past Bullet, getting him tangled in the laser. Danny cuts Wulf free from the laser and grabs it] Go ghost stinger! [He sends green energy onto the laser, which makes Bullet vanish in pain. Danny and Wulf land, while Wulf glares at Danny] Friend. Uh [Holds hand out] Friend? 
Don't worry. He's not much of a threat. Now if my mom were here, then we'd be in trouble. [A targeting laser appears on Wulf's head] 
Oh. Man. You are SO not getting anything for Mother's Day. Come on. 
Besides your the only one of us who sort of understands him, and we need to get that collar off. 
I gotta get my Fenton Thermos out of my locker. In the meantime see if you can find out what Walker's up to. [Flies through the roof and leaves] 
Here we go. [Ghost sense goes off, and he hears Dash nearby] 
Meeting? [Transforms into human and walks into the room] What town meeting? 
[Shocked] Walker! 
Walker, lemme go! 
The only thing I'm begging for, [Transforms and blasts Walker back] Is for you to try some mouthwash! [Flies off] 
Wow. I waited all puberty for a girl to say that to me and now it's a complete bummer. [Throws her at a billboard] 
Ghost shield. Ghost shield. [Hits a button on the wall which activates a ghost shield around the house, pushing the pursuers back] 
I fell asleep? [Sees the still-activee ghost shield] At least the shield's still up. [Sees the clock] And it's 10:18!? [Zooms out to show Sam and Tucker next to the clock] 
How'd you guys get in? The shield's still up. 
Walker's overshadowing everybody around me. I think he's trying to turn everyone in town against me. 
It's not funny, Tuck. I'm getting my butt kicked all over the place. At school, at home, and now this? I'll be public ghost enemy number one! 
Are you nuts? If I leave this house, I'm dead. 
I... might be too young to vote, but I'm casting one anyway! [The crowd goes into panic] You people have to listen to me. I'm on your side. 
[To himself] My parents might be overshadowed, but this should harmlessly push the ghosts out of them. [Blasts the ground near his parents, knocking them back] Or they could not be overshadowed, and I could have totally ticked them off. 
[To the mayor] Walker! I should've guessed you'd end up in the guy that makes the rules! 
[Holds up his thermos] Shouldn't you? 
One down, four to go. 
Yeah. With some friendly advice: RUN!!! 
Where's the thermos? 
What are you doing? 
Wulf! No! 
[Frowns] Oh man, I have got to start paying more attention in these fights. 
[Smiles.] With that, I bid you a fond fair farewell. [Flies out of city hall through the roof.] 
Duh, I'll see you at dinner. 
Well, somebody's gotta. Hey, not me? Who's gonna protect this town? Besides, it not like I can ignore a scream for help. 
Except, that one. [Danny, Sam, and Tucker laugh as the screen closes on them.] 
Geez, it's hot. Aren't you sweating, Sam? 
(Sniffs the air around Sam) I think you're overcooked. 
How can I? I'm in front of you. 
Well... this is humiliating. 
Well this isn't. We've got company, Tuck. 
It's Johnny 13's Shadow. I've got to find a place to go ghost. 
[Offscreen] Hey, tall, dark, and formless! [onscreen. Shadow turns around and sees Danny. Cut to Danny lunging at him] Remember me? 
I'll take that as a yes. Come on slick. Let's see how well you mix with water. Enjoy your trip through the sewers! Oh and if you see Monday's meatloaf, say hi for me. 
Guys we've got a problem. 
It's worse than that. Paulina saw. She knows I'm half ghost. I finally get to see her in a bathing suit and I can't even enjoy it! 
R-really? 
So, you think it's cool that I've got these powers? 
I'm hot? I'm hot? I'm hot! 
Is anybody looking at me funny? 
How can I lighten up? Paulina knows I'm half ghost! I mean, she says she's gonna keep the secret but how can I trust her? She's a girl! Girls can't keep secrets. Uh, except for you. You're…different. 
You're making it really hard for me to keep a low profile. Looking for me? 
W-where did you come from? 
I-I'm really happy that you're cool with this Paulina. But everyone's kinda staring at us. 
You mean, like a date? 
Officially? Like a club? 
That's cheating. Or…creative point scoring. I'll be right back after your strike. 
(chuckles) It's good to be the best. 
I'm the luckiest guy in the world. 
Kitty? Johnny? Paulina. Oh great. I'm in the middle of a love rectangle! 
Uh, this is all a big mistake. 
I'm going ghost! 
Optional sun roof. Nice. 
He can ride in and out of the ghost zone when he wants now? 
No. We should probably talk about something a little more important. 
Well you're about 8 shadow attacks too late. What's the story? 
Sam? I-I… 
Except Paulina. You realize you're going to have to stop this, right? 
It's Inviso-bill. 
I'm losing my mind. I mean, Paulina's fairly high maintenance. 
Radical's good. Let's hear it. 
Well, here goes nothing. I hope you're right about this Sam. 
You've got to take Kitty back. She is suffocating me. I need my space. You gotta help me! 
Okay. Here's the plan. 
Anything for you. You were worth fighting Johnny for. 
And you know what? I'd kick his butt a hundred times more and a hundred times harder if he ever shows his sorry face again. 
Bring it on punk. 
My turn. 
Then pretend that didn't hurt. 
That I did. And now I'm gonna finish you off for good. Seeya in oblivion Johnny. 
Hey I don't want to get between you two. Kitty, you're a great girl but I'm nowhere near as cool as Johnny. And you two are obviously made for each other. 
Just to make sure you can't come back… 
Should have played that a little closer to the vest. 
Um hi. Do you know who I am by any chance? 
Uh I need a publicist. 
Hey Paulina. 
Can you believe that? Paulina's still in love but with the wrong me. 
Oh well. I have to say, it's good to be back among friends. But the popularity sure was nice while it lasted. 
[overshadowing Tucker] Hi, I'm Tucker! Don't let the PDA, glasses, and lack of muscles fool you. I'm a stud. 
Yeah. The problem is, I can only split myself this far. 
Vlad Plasmius can turn into like four different Vlads at once. That's what this weekend is about. 
Nonstop drills. 
No homework, 
no family, 
no interruptions. 
Legitimately boring, I'm guessing. 
Do you want the truth, or one of those little white lies that doesn't hurt your feelings? 
[surprised] The Rockies? That's nowhere near Florida. What gives? 
[to himself] I know one way... 
[swatting her hand away in alarm] Yeah, I'm--fine. 
[crossly] You carry a lot of stuff, Mom. How about a Fenton Cell Phone so we can call for help? 
You're up to something... 
[sarcastically] Yeah, it's almost like it's some sort of villainous plot. [scowling] What an incredibly well-planned coincidence. 
[Getting back up by the still-smoking chair] Um, correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Dad possessed by some filthy, putrid,(smiling) lonely, single ghost? 
[cheerily] Bye Vlad! And as a lonely single man in your 40s, might I suggest internet dating? Or a cat! 
Pass. 
Yah! Ok! I get it! Stop touching me. 
Look, I'm gonna sleep over here, ok? [He practically runs away, dragging the sleeping bag away from the fire where Maddie is sitting.] 
Mm-hmm. [Rolling over] Good night. 
Either Mom needs to shave her legs, or this is really bad news. 
[Standing] Nice petting zoo, Plasmius. [He goes ghost.] Where's your lonely-guy cat? 
W-wh-what was that? 
[to himself, looking at his wrist where she's holding him] Wow, that doesn't hurt. 
[As she pulls out a double strike staff] How can she not have a phone in there? 
[Running over to hug her arm] You are awesome! 
[nervously] Uh, wait for me! [he dashes after her.] 
I, uh, think we gave those ghost animals the slip. Uh...shouldn't we figure out a way to call Dad? 
[Jumping down to the ground] But he's my archenemy! I mean, he...said all those horrible things about Dad. 
[Looking down gingerly at the belt] Great. At midnight, I get my powers back. At 12:01, the belt zaps me, and at 12:02, Vlad tries to make out with my mom. [Cringing] Those are going to be the worst two minutes of my life. 
Oh, great. Ten to twelve. [to Maddie] Are you sure you want to do this? 
[With fake cheeriness] Sure. You and Vlad get cozy. If you need me, I'll be over there [gesturing over his shoulder, then turns with the key, scowling again] barfing. 
[to himself] Mom is gone, which means...[removing the Specter Deflector] ...time to spend a little quality time with Uncle Vlad. 
But first-- [going to the clock, he pushes the hands so it looks like it's 15 until 12:00, then approaches Vlad, still reading his book.] Hey, um, Uncle Vlad? 
[innocently] How can you say that? You think my mom made the decision to come back on her own? We're a family. We both talked about it last night, and I want to stay here with you too. 
Yes, I do. Come on, give me a big hug, new Dad! 
[looking at his watch] Oh, yeah. [The clock goes to 12:00, and Danny transforms to ghost mode.] A much fairer fight! 
Jeez, I don't know which head to hit. So I'll have to hit them both! [Launching himself into the air and diving] At 112 miles per hour, I bet this hurts! 
Finish me? But why are you mad at me? I'm not the one who made your pelts into wall art. [Gestures at the hunting trophies on the wall.] 
And now you're not. I'll give you a five-minute head start, Plasmius. 
Minutes, seconds. You know how bad I can be at math. [to the animal ghosts] Get him! 
He...ran out for a bite. How are we getting out of here? 
Maybe we could just take the copter? 
Actually, I think Mom's the word. Sorry I was such a jerk. I really had a good time. [Offering her the soda] Backwash? 
Uh... 
Totally dull. 
I gotta go call Tucker and Sam. But, um. [Kisses Maddie's cheek] You know. 
So, how was your weekend? 
Well, I guess everything's back to normal then. 
[After staring a moment, takes a sip of the drink then spits] Oh, gross! Backwash! 
One good thing about ghost powers: No fighting the school bus crowds. 
Nope. But I bet you forgot about that. 
Look, I don't want to hurt you! 
I'll be waiting, creep! 
You watch it, creep! 
I am so not kissing the bride! 
Let me get this straight: We need to take care of a flour sack and pretend it's our baby? 
Not to mention dangerous! Now I've got to spend a week playing house with an ecto-hating ghostophobe. 
Fine! I'm glad we worked that out! 
And by “our” you mean “mine”. 
You can't just set it down. These things need constant motion. 
I've been a parent all of one day and my grade is probably already down to a C-minus. 
That would require having the whole family. But Mommy is too busy with her job to pull her weight and keep this kid quiet! 
[Danny's sack farts.] Oh come on!! 
[sack farts again] Then why does it smell like beans? 
Where'd you get all this stuff. 
Ah man! Can you watch the kid for me? 
Now where's that lame-o Box Ghost? 
Oh, she's too busy to watch the kids, but when it comes time to kick my butt, she's front-and-center. [to Valerie] Don't you have anything better to do? 
Tucker! 
You can bill me later. Right now I've gotta stop this fight before anyone gets hurt. 
[Handing a five-dollar bill to Tucker] Fine. Whatever. Right now I just want to find Valerie and give her our kid. And a piece of my mind! 
Please move! [Shoves Nat aside] 
Valerie? It's Danny. And Junior. You're taking the kid. Now. 
I know all about your stupid job. 
It doesn't matter. Free ride's over. Now get your lazy butt in gear and start pulling your own weight. 
Great! Then you might think about changing that diaper. 
Skulker! What are you doing? 
Skulker! No! 
Wait! It's not what you think! 
(over his shoulder as he flies with the sack ahead of his body) You don't understand. This is all a trick. By a ghost named Skulker. 
See? I'm putting the sack down, right here. You don't want to hurt me, and you don't want to hurt this, right? (points to the sack). 
No, it's not me! 
Okay, in order: This is the Ghost Zone; that's Skulker, the Ghost Zone's greatest hunter; and other than you dislocating my shoulder, we're about to be hunted like animals. 
[as they are running away] Less freaking! More running! 
Oh, man! These handcuffs must cancel out my all my ghost powers! 
No! Don't! It might be— 
Booby trapped. See, that's why I took the time to explain to explain the whole Ghost Zone's greatest hunter thing. 
[dart in butt] I... can't... move. 
[as Valerie is dragging him behind her] Well, on the bright side, she's finally starting to pull her own weight. 
What?! No! Listen to me! 
Could you slow down for a moment? This is the Ghost Zone, and I am a ghost. I can help us both. 
Head for a door. Any door! Sometimes they're portals between the Ghost Zone and Earth. 
Not that door!! 
I can move again. Thanks for the save back there. 
[Picking up a rock] Right. [begins beating on the handcuffs cable against a bigger rock.] Because clearly the maniac who cuffed and dragged us in here didn't have anything to do with it. 
What do you mean by that? 
Uh, maybe you weren't pulling your weight?! 
[sympathetically] Two jobs? 
Even though I have absolutely no idea why that sack is so important. 
Go high! 
Hey, I think we finally got this teamwork thing down! 
And dude! You are a horrible mother! 
Giving Skulker a taste of his own booby trap! 
Please, don't get up on our account. 
That's because you never bothered to get to know one. Truce? [holds out hand] 
Zone. It's more of a zone. 
But, if you insist [goes ghost and invisible] We're going to have to do it my way, though! [overshadows Valerie] 
Now to get out of here before she—oh, man! You gotta be kiddin' me!  Danny has just noticed the Nasty Nat costume is on the floor of Valerie's room. As Danny picks up the costume, Val wakes up. Danny hides behind the costume as he turns back to Danny Fenton. 
[revealing himself] Uh, sorry. The door was open and I, uh, according to your chart it's my turn to take the baby, and— 
I won't tell anybody! Wow, this is like the worst job ever. I didn't know this was the job you were talking about. 
Yeah. You're right. And I'm supposed to be the good guy. 
Uh, nothing, nothing. So, uh, is there anything I can do to make it up to you? 
Yeah. The other day I was such a jerk to, to, uh, the person wearing this thing I figured I would give that person the day off. 
I didn't say it was Valerie. 
(Off-screen.) Thanks for driving me to school today, Jazz. 
Yeah, sometimes it’s nice to avoid the bus-- (Danny flings his arm back, closing his eyes, there are no more people behind them.) --and quietly and anonymously-- (Danny puts his hand down and his eyes roll to Jazz.) --slip into school. 
Why? 
What’s going on? 
It’s not a ghost! (Half-closes his eyes and closes his palm.) It’s an out-of-shape teacher in a mask! 
And it’ll be six more by the time I get done with all this extra work Lancer assigned me. 
Dad,-- (Cut to Danny, rubbing the back of his neck with his hand. He looks up.) --are you familiar with the term (Glares and drops his arm.) “Stay away from my school”? 
Sam, (scoffs) the “best-known”, they’re not the “best”. 
(Off-screen) The Groovy Gang and Scaredy Cat… 
(Off-screen) Extreme Ghostbreakers… 
The government’s ghost hunting squad, Guys in White. 
It’s a virtual “who’s who” of who can’t catch ghosts. (Danny’s fingers curl up, his eyes wide open with realization.) Which means he should be-- (Sam stops smiling, Danny slumps his arm down and makes a *sigh* expression.) --arriving any second now. 
(chuckles) I’ve got nothing to worry about. 
(Removing his hand.) What do you want me to do? I can’t go ghost here! Besides-- (Cut to Tucker, Danny and Sam.) --nobody’s in any real danger yet, right? 
And, now they are. (He looks to the right, and walks to the left off-screen.) 
Plasmius! 
What are you doing here? 
So you hired these idiots? 
As much as I’d enjoy catching up, (Bends his hands and takes off with many puffs of smoke.) Plasmius,-- (Cut to Danny flying with with his fists up and his ghostly tail cascading below him.) --shouldn't you be getting home to the love of your life? 
Oh,-- (Danny giggles, and he swoops around Vlad’s energy beam, getting closer to the camera. He stops in a fighting stance, more beams blast off behind him.) --that’s right! Dad married the love of your life. (Danny flies off-screen. Close up on Danny.) You’re bitter and alone! 
You know, (Zoom in slowly.) I think I liked it better when they were laughing. 
Uh, (Blinks, looks to the right.) um-- (Close up on Danny.) --boo? 
Yes! That’s exactly why he’s here. (Tucker walks in next to Sam. Danny starts to fiddle with the panel.) To make my dad look like a fool. (Cut to the staircase, Jack walks downstairs happily as Danny continues off-screen. Jack walks toward the camera to the left.) I mean, did you see the way those ghost hunters were laughing at him? 
(Looking up from the filtrator.) How embarrassing! 
We’re all gonna have to live with my dad’s goof-ups-- (Danny shrugs, Jack looks upset.) --for the rest of our lives. 
He’s right behind me, isn't he? (All three look up at Jack. Cut to Jack.) 
Great. (Lowers his eyelids.) I just managed to do Plasmius’ job for him. 
Yeah, (Points a finger.) and not just any ghost. 
Public Ghost Enemy #1. 
Booooo! (Danny pauses and looks at Jack, who is still sitting at the table dejectedly.) Whoo-ooo-ooo! (Cut to Jack, not even remotely fazed. He looks to the right and places a hand on his chin.) 
Fear me! 
Hello! (Danny stops waving and curls his fingers into a fist. Pan right. Danny sneaks behind Jack with his ghostly tail and is on his right, raising his arms.) Ghost! (Cut to Jack, looking bored with his chin in his hand. Danny pops in upside down, waving his hand in front of Jack.) Right in front of ya! 
(Pointing at Jack.) Just the opposite,-- (Danny’s head pops up with realization. He then looks back down at Jack.) --Jack. (Cut to Danny, he raises his shoulders and looks with glee.) Cool, I just called my dad by his first name. (He then looks with realization, then goes back into his determined character. Cut to Danny looking at Jack. Jack looks up at Danny.) 
And fear you. That’s why I’ve come to turn myself in-- (Danny points at Jack.) --to you. 
You-you-- you can’t do that! 
Okay,-- (Danny looks toward the out pipe of the Weasel.) --this wasn't part of the plan. 
(In the tank, sound metallically muffled.) Ugh, gross. (The tank vibrates and rattles.) Hello! I’m right here! Hello! 
(In the Weasel.) Please! Stop! (Cut to the tank as it’s dragged along the litter-covered ground.) You should know (The tank hits a rock and keeps going.) what you’re getting into (The tank hits another rock.) here! 
Thanks. Now I’m crushed by space and guilt. (Looking more determined.) Look! (The screen clangs again.) You have to listen to me! (Cut to a side view of Jack dragging the Weasel.) All of this is a trap! 
Does that answer your question? 
Wait a minute, you already have a ghost portal! 
Uh-oh. 
You have to listen to me! (Cut to the tank.) We have to get to your house and fast! 
You’re gonna lose more than that if your ghost portal explodes. 
Did he clean the lab? 
Does he clean his room? 
Ah, would he, ah, I dunno, forget to install a handle on the inside of a weapons vault, er, something? 
Uh… you just did. 
Good thing my dad’s a lousy negotiator. (Looks down with heroic bravado.) Jack,-- (Raises arms in glee.) --man that’s cool, heh-- (Returns to bravado.) You've got a deal. 
Then don’t! (Tenses.) I can take care of these (Outstretches his arm and points.) idiots! (Cut to Danny. He pulls Jack to him by the collar, looks up at him, and points behind himself.) Go save our family! Ah—I-I mean yours! (Danny perspires as Jack looks at him funny.) Your family. Not mine. 
Boo. 
Oh man, (Floats back a little with his ghostly tail.) this is just too easy. 
Get the kitty! (Danny opens the lid and puts the dog inside.) Get him! 
Now, to stop Plasmius! 
Dad! (Danny phases fully through the wall and assumes a battle pose.) I better-- 
Whoa! 
Whoa, he’s all over this! (Clenches his fists.) Which means-- (With a flash of light, two rings transform him into Danny Fenton.) --it’s time to do my chores! (Danny runs off-screen.) 
(Popping onscreen.) Well, the table’s clear. 
(Off-screen) Beakers are taken care of… 
Aaand the trash has been taken out. (Zoom out to reveal the portal behind Danny.) Which means I have (turns to the portal) plenty of time for-- (Danny runs toward the blinking ecto-filtrator.) 
The new filtrator. (Close up on a perspiring Danny.) Where’s the new filtrator?! (Cut to Danny, sweating and holding the old cylinder. Jack’s glove comes in from the right holding the new one.) Uh--I probably should've done this (Puts down his hands meekly.) any of the five times that you told me to. 
That was awesome! 
Why do you even have this simulation on your laptop? 
I won’t. (Danny and Jack get up. Danny points up at Jack.) And you shouldn't forget this. (Danny knocks his elbow into Jack.) I’m really proud of you, Dad. I can’t believe you beat that ghost back into the Ghost Zone. (Danny puts down his arms, Jack puts his gigantic hand over Danny’s shoulders.) 
(Pointing up a finger.) I’ll remember my chores-- 
And I thought the merchandise is flying off the shelves is just an expression. (Comes in and fires a couple of ecto-blasts at them.) 
Woah! Who are you guys? 
Hey! I'm not a hat person! Especially if the hat is a dwarf! (throws dwarf ghost off) 
Okay, all things considered, maybe the tiny hat guy was better. 
You know, it's ghosts like you that give ghosts like me a bad name. 
Although it's hard to come up with a worse name than that. (phases through the floor, leaving the jewelry on the floor) 
Hey Sam, I got that Morbid Anti-social Youth CD you wanted. 
What? Have you heard "My Parents Reek"? That cut rocks! 
(trance-like) Cross over to the dark side... (eyes glow) 
Cross over to the dark side... 
(blinks) What? Um, sorry, Sam, musta got a little spacey. (rubs head) I was up pretty late last night. 
Where are you going? School's this way. (points back) 
Sam... 
Don't blame me if you get caught! 
And speaking of getting caught. (looks up to see the rest of the ghosts, also carrying bags) I'm goin' ghost! 
Opening a new bank account? Don't forget your free toaster! (fires ecto blast which knocks the money sack out of the dwarf's hands) 
Oh great, more fans. 
Terrific. The crooks got away, I'm late for school, and, I've never seen so many goths out in broad daylight. 
(lands) What? I'm not in trouble. 
(goes invisible) No. 
Make them see us for who we are... (eyes turn red) Hey everyone! (waves arms) Over here! We're Danny Fenton and Sam Manson! We cut school and we're proud of it! 
I'm sorry! I don't know what came over me back there. 
We can always go to the circus tomorrow. That is, assuming we're not grounded and your parents let me within two-hundred feet of you. 
Unleash your dark side at Circus Gothica... (walks towards the door) 
(overshadowing Lancer) Unleash your dark side at Circus Gothica... (walks into janitor closet) 
No such thing as too much trouble. Unleash your dark side at Circus Gothica. (phases through ceiling) 
Sam? 
(controlled again) How should I scare you? (backs off) 
Ecto-butts in gear! 
This party's just getting started! (follows) 
Oh please! (fires ecto blast at the cars' tires) 
(blinks) Tucker? Sam? I.. I.. 
(shaking) I... (eyes glow) ..am a.. ghost. I have no friends. 
(groans) Quiet! (holds head) All of you! I need to think! 
Sam? SAM! 
I think so. It's all a blur. I did some bad stuff, didn't I? 
Only one way to find out. 
You wanted a big haul? Try this on for size! 
So, what d'ya say we stick around and explain to the cops we were being controlled by an evil ringmaster? 
Ya know, I had a feeling that would be their answer. (phases out as well) 
At least Freakshow is in custody and the stolen goods were returned. 
Isn’t it everything I told you it would be and more? 
No. 
No. 
Okay. [puts down the suit] I showed you the Portal, [looks to the Portal, hoping this is over] can we get out of here now? 
My parents could be back here any minute. (looks back to his friends) Besides, they say it doesn’t work anyway. 
You know what? You’re right. Who knows what kind of [looks up] awesome, super-cool things exist on the other side of that Portal? 
Sam, I’m the good guy! So unless these super-awesome trucks are being used for evil, I *can’t* do anything. 
And rims. 
I wonder what this button does. 
Get away, fiend! Whatever you do, leave this truck alone! 
Yeah, well, it hasn’t stopped Sam [Looks to Sam with scorn.] from busting my chops about cruelty to un-living plastic animals. 
Oh, duh! 
That’s because-- [Paulina holds out a paper, Danny takes it and looks at it.] --when you invited me, [Looks forward.] I thought you were joking. 
Really? 
Me? 
The ghost boy? [Danny smiles and calls after her.] Oh, he’ll be there, Paulina! I promise! 
Oh, come on, Sam, [Looks to his invite.] we never get invited to [Gestures to the paper.] these parties. 
You’re coming to the party too, right? 
All right, gruesome. What do you want? [Cut to Danny with his torn sleeve, continuing his interrogation.] Who sent you? 
[Putting his hands on the table.] Actually, it was more like,-- [He lifts his hands wiggling his fingers and talking in a spooky manner for effect.] --“Saaaaam…”-- [He puts his hands back on the edge of the table.] --but you get the point. 
Well, it’s got [Smiles explaining this.] something to do with you,-- [He leans back and puts out a palm to Sam.] --but don’t worry. [He leans his palm downward and closes his eyes.] I saved Paulina, so-- [Close-up on Danny, smiling.] --you don’t have to apologize. 
Sam, something weird is going on and you’re clearly the cause of it. [Danny closes his eyes, calming down.] It’s probably better for all of us-- [He lifts up both his palms and flicks them down.] --if you just lay low. 
Paulina? [Eyes widen.] Again? [Cut to Sam from behind looking to Danny, who is looking to the side.] This is going to have to wait. [Pan up as Danny stands up from his seat at the ready. Sam looks up to him.] I’m going ghost! 
Stay here. 
Well, let’s see-- [Cut to Danny, resuming color.] --if we can’t change that a little. 
What? 
Nice save! [Cut to Sam with her hands on the edge of the fountain as Danny walks up.] Although, to be fair, I probably [Puts out his hands to explain.] wouldn’t’ve needed it- [Sam reaches out to help Danny out.] --if it weren’t for you in the first place. [Danny takes Sam’s hand with both of his climbing one foot out of the water.] 
Welcome to my world, remember? [He smiles as he puts out a palm as an example.] “We should make the menu recyclo-vegetarian!” [He points upwards with more seriousness as if protesting.] “We should let the gorilla out!” [He smiles and shrugs again.] “We should sell all of your dad’s stuff at a garage sale!” [Danny crosses his arms, making his point.] 
Sam, both monsters knew your name. [Arches his eyebrows.] Either there’s another Sam involved in ghost fighting-- [Close-up on Danny.] --or it’s you. [Cut to Danny from behind looking at Sam standing by the fountain.] 
She would if she wanted me to come to her party! 
Way to go, Fenton. [Looks to the side.] You just ticked off one of the only two-- [He holds out his arms, showing importance of the situation.] --real friends you have. 
Sam! Wait! 
Desiree? [Cut to Danny, confused.] You look-- [A ring forms around Danny’s waist to transform him back into Danny Phantom.] --different. 
What do you want? 
Oh. Oh no! 
So, what do you want to do tomorrow? 
Do I know you? 
[Genuinely confused.] No, seriously, do I know you? 
[Cowering his arms covering his head for impact.] Ghost! 
Look, kid. [Removes his palm from her arm.] I don’t know who you are or what you’re talking about. [Shrugs.] All I know is,-- [Cut to Danny and Sam far in the hallway.] --I am-- [Danny runs off closer to the camera, Sam turns to him.] --outta here! 
Believe what? [Grows incredulous.] That I had super powers? [He turns to Sam and points to her.] You and I are best friends-- [He makes his finger a palm and then retracts it back to his strap.] --even though I never met you? [Cut to Danny, truly disbelieving to the point of being bugged.] And you’re the only one that knows it? 
Yeah. [Rolls his eyes downward.] You broke into my locker and doctored an old photo of me. [He dreamily lifts his hand up to rest his chin on it.] You must really like me. [His eyes widen, considering another option.] Or you’re nuts. [He removes his hand and looks forward.] You’re not nuts, are you? 
[Offscreen.] Wait a minute. That’s my parent’s lab! 
Who are you? 
[Finishing.] Super powers? 
That, [Puts down his hand.] might just be the coolest girl on the planet. 
That happen a lot? 
Okay, you got my attention. 
Cool. [Looks to the Portal.] How’s it going over there? 
No. [He puts his hands behind him to refer to something in the past.] But you saw those things, those-- [He curls his hands into fists looking for the word.] --monsters,-- [He spreads his arms out downward and leans toward the chamber of the Portal.  ] --ghosts! [He points behind himself with his thumb.] Those ghosts were attacking our school. [Cut to Danny.] Besides-- [Cut to the inside of the chamber of the Portal looking out. Danny smiles with curiosity as he looks inside.] --I always wanted to go in here. [Cut to Danny from the front, looking up.] Who knows what kind of awesome, super-cool things exist on the other side of that portal? 
Well, [Zips it.] here goes everything. [Cut to Sam, holding a white sticker of the emblem she circles earlier. Tucker stands behind her.] 
Uh, what is that? 
You’re right! [Looks up.] I am a ghost! [Close-up on Danny, amazed.] Cool! [He seems confused if he should think that way.] Is this cool? 
Change back? [Arches his eyebrows.] How? 
I call that a “fake-out make-out”. 
[Offscreen.] So-- [Cut to Danny and Sam in class sitting at adjacent desks. Danny leans to talk to Sam, putting a hand on her chair and holding up his other palm.] --now what? 
And this is worse. [He has sunk through the floor completely. Offscreen.] Hey, why is there all this meat down here? 
Okay. [Cut closer to Danny as meteors fall in the sky.] I’m… going to-- [Zoom out as he points to the sky.] --become ghostly! 
Nah. 
Where’d my legs go?! 
What do I do? [Looks to the left for a cue.] What do I do? 
For what, soup? 
Ghost ray, ghost ray. [He holds out a palm to shoot out a ghost ray, but looks as his butt starts to glow green. He’s confused about it.] 
Well, that can’t be right. But it’ll have to do! [Danny turns around to point his butt forward, shooting a ghost ray out of it.] 
Now, [Tries to screw off the lid of the thermos.] while she’s both grossed out and off-guard, I’ll… [He uncaps it, and tries to dump something out of it, but then turns back, shrugging with the thermos and cap in his hands.] I don’t know how to use this! 
I don’t need to remember everything to know-- [He stretches out his arm and points his finger.] --I have to stop you! [Danny suddenly retracts his arm as he changes back to Danny Fenton without warning. He looks down at his current form, and then looks back.] Although, remembering would be nice. 
Did you do something to my costume? 
Yeah, [Looks up.] I probably should. 
I never realized how different my life would have been if I [Looks to Sam.] hadn’t met you. [Closes his eyes.] I gotta say, [Looks to Sam.] it’s sorta cool to know. 
So you have wished it, so shall it be. 
Anybody up for a Game of Slug Bug? 
Paulina! [Paulina smiles] You should run. [She holds her arms out and starts running towards him] No, not toward me. Away! Run! 
Bug... [Flies up last second so the bug hits the wires and gets electrocuted] ...Zapper. [The bug explodes into hundreds of tiny ghost bugs, who all fly into the school] Well, one down, a billion to go. 
Fwe, what is that smell? [puts hand over nose] 
Tuck, you smell like a sweaty cookie. 
Tucker? [waves hand in front of Tucker's face] Hello. Whats wrong with him? 
You're afraid of the nurse's office? 
It's Tucker's cologne [Ghost sense goes off, and we see Paulina with a ghostly glow] Uhh, is Paulina glowing? 
Bug bite? [a ghost bug flies by Danny's face and bites Jazz as she is walking through the halls] 
Cover me guys. I'm going ghost! [runs to an open room. Sam and Tucker guard door. We see a flash of light. (Danny's ghost rings) Danny goes intangible and goes through the door and floor. He goes to the basement and catches a swarm in the Fenton Thermos.] 
Well, that's all of them [a ghost bug flies by and bites Sam's arm] 
Except one.  
Or more. [Dash phases through bathroom door. Danny opens bathroom door.] Hey, Dash, uh not that I care, but are you okay? [Danny walks up to stall Dash is in] 
Yeah, this always happens on goulash day. [Dash shoots two ecto-plasmic beams at Danny] Although I've never seen goulash do that. [Dash breaks stall door open and comes out a ghost monster] 
I wish I could say I didn't want to do this, but... [Dash reverts back to human form and collapses on Danny's shoulder] Ugh, and just one cheap shot away from a semester full of payback. 
Bleh! 
What's up? 
Tucker, get rid of that thing! 
That's weird, I figured my ghost powers were protecting me. What's protecting you? [bug flies off] 
Wow. Its not just repelling, it's a repellent. [the door where the sick students are held opens and a doctor walks out] 
Well, I don't trust him. Sam and Jazz are in that hospital, and we've got to find out what's going on. 
Tucker, I said we. 
Phe, I go invisible, I go ghost, I'll be in and out in no time. Just watch. 
Aaa! 
We can't do that Tucker. The fact the hospital has a ghost shield around it makes it even more suspicious. If I can't get in as a ghost [reverts to human form] I'll have to get in like a kid. Okay, just hang out here and wait for me. You got my mom's Fenton utility weapon just in case? 
Okay then. [jumps in Tucker's arms] Let's make this good. [closes eyes and Tucker walks him to hospital entrance 
Are you kidding? I have been trying to do that trick for months. That's so wrong. 
Jazz? 
I'm going [turns Jazz's head around] ghost! [goes ghost and flies through the rooms into Paulina's] Somebody need some help? PAULINA! Uh, it is Paulina, right? 
Uh, hi Miss. Can you excuse me for one minute? [flies to Sam, and puts curtain back] Sam, are you alright? I heard a scream. 
Actually, I kinda doubt that. 
[gets Sam and puts her on the ground] Uh, be right there. [Danny flies back to Paulina and Sam floats to the ceiling] 
It's called a ghost sense. [Danny's ghost sense goes off] See, it lets you know a ghost is near. 
That bug bite gave you ghost powers. Didn't anybody explain anything to you? 
Hold that thought. [gets Sam and puts her in bed] 
Sam? Paulina? Getting tired. Gas is affecting me? [Dr. Bert Rand pulls the curtain back] 
Your Penelope Spectra's assistant, Bertrand. [he face palms as he realizes the one detail he missed] Bert Rand, Bertrand. How did I miss that? [Falls to ground] 
Tucker's right, hospitals stink. [falls asleep] 
Uh ah, where am I? [looks around then struggles to try and free himself]  
Somebody tell me what's happening here! [bright lights are turned on Danny looks up to see Spectra in her shadowy form.] 
Spectra? 
LET ME GO! 
HEEEEEEEELP! 
TUCKEEEEEEER! 
What do you want? 
So, the ghost bugs, the virus? 
Nearly flawless? 
And the ghost powers? 
You'll never get away with this, Spectra. 
[A vacuum-like hose comes out] If she's so hot on getting Fenton DNA, maybe I can provide a substitute! [reaches for tissue Jack gave to him, then pushes it towards the hose, as it travels into the cabinet with Spectra's body, as it steams.] 
Excellent! [Spectra pulls him out] I mean, you fiend! [Spectra gets in her new body and leaves, laughing maniacally.] 
Tucker! you broke into the hospital! Wait, you broke into a hospital? 
What's up, Doc? 
Paulina, I mean whatever your name is, no! [flies to Paulina and pushes her down before the ecto beam shot out] 
Dude, your bed side manners stink. I think its time we sent you back to nursing school [catches Bertrand in Fenton thermos.] 
No! 
You wanted Fenton DNA. Unfortunately, you got it, courtesy of my dad's nose. [Spectra turns into snot; she squeals in distress] There's a "you blew it" pun here somewhere, but I'd rather not. [Spectra jumps on top of Danny] 
Will you please [yelling] get off me?! [he punches her nose and his hand goes in and is covered in snot] You know, if my life wasn't at stake, I would hurl right now. [he kicks Spectra and she stick to the ceiling]  
See, that's the kind of pun I was avoiding with the whole "blew it" comment. 
Uh yaa do you smell gym shorts and ginger snaps. 
Way to come threw in the clutch, Tuck. 
Oh come on Tuck, we beat Spectra, and you should be fine in 8-10 weeks, it could be worse. 
And know it’s worse. 
Still technically not a cry for help. 
[Sighs.] Ah! 
Clear skies and no moon. [The focus pans to the end of the telescope, some shooting stars are seen shooting across the skies in it's lens.] A perfect night for stargazing. 
Survey says going ghost! 
Hey isn't it past your bedtime kid? 
Hey. They're stealing my dad's ghost shield generator. 
Hey considering he just took my dad's ghost shield, you think maybe your could be a little sympathetic, like Tucker. (Tucker laughs) Tucker? 
Mom, dad, fyi when you're 14 easy listening isn't that easy. Could I please turn this off? 
You can't possibly like this music that much. 
Um, that would be the warning signal. 
I don't get it. The ghost shield's gone and it barely registers a blip on the parental radar. 
Sweet! Where do I sign up to yank this crud off the air? 
I'll show you who will listen. (On the speaker) What do we want?! (Cricket chirps) Um, this is the part where you said good music. What do we want?! 
Being ignored does, occasionally, have its advantages. (Offscreen) Going ghost! 
Hate to break this to you guys, but you can't build muscle tone without muscle. Another playdate with captain kid. 
Oh great. Hide-and-seek again. 
I can't help thinking it has something to do with this lousy music. 
And where would we get the equipment to do that? (Sam points to the emergency ops center) (chuckles) No way. (The trio go into the kitchen) Mom, dad! I really wanna use the emergency ops center to start a radio station. 
(Reading a note) Your mother, sister and I are on a weekend getaway fun cruise. We're sure you will take charge and act responsibly. Love mom and dad. (Pulls the note away). M.Bersback Cruise Lines. Weird. They went on a fun cruise with Jazz? Who isn't fun in the least. You know what this means. 
The music, the pirate ghosts, my parents, and now this cruise ship? Something weird's going on and we need to get to the bottom of it. 
[Focus moves to Danny and Tucker side] It's like this cruise is attracting every adult in town. And my sister who thinks she's an adult. 
Party? What party? 
You already made up a logo? 
[Taking away bag and paper with acrostic logo] This is serious, guys! There's something suspicous about this cruise! (Throws both items into nearby trash can) I can't focus on the party with my parents out of town 
Still in port. Good thing I'm not too late.(Goes into a dive towards the ship, but winces away, prevented by some previously invisible force) W-why can't I get aboard? (A transparent ball of green glowing energy surrounding the ship has become visible) It's like there's some kind of..ghost shield! 
Ok, pewee, talk. Tell me what you want with these people or I'll-I'll spank you or something! 
Great, this snot nose punk can get people to follow orders but I can't? 
(Gasps in surprise and camera view turns to reveal a completely empty dock where the ship used to be) Well one things for sure, it's going to be awfully quiet at my house tonight. 
Not getting invited to a party is one thing. But not getting invited to party at my own house! (Danny walks over and picks up a plug to the nearest machine which seems to be the source of the noise however it isn't) Hey, where's the music coming from? 
(offscreen) Wait! (Camera moves with Danny from the doorway of the Ops center to the booth) Guys. you've got to stop the broadcast,the party downstairs is getting out of control! 
How can you not know? 
You took a vapor drone promo disc? 
Wait a minute-play that backwards again, slowly 
More like mind control. 
(Getting up) Going ghost! (The two white transformation rings appear, turning Danny's human form into his ghost one) 
(While firing ectoblasts at the shield) What, is the music career going so poorly that you've had to pick up babysitting jobs on the side? 
Activate the defense system! 
I don't know! Just start pressing buttons! 
(Watching from the window) Whoa! Sam, what did you do? 
(Standing with Sam and Tucker on top of Fentonworks above the chaos below) I need to get our parents back! 
Maybe Danny Phantom can't but Danny Fenton CAN. 
(Quick pan to the arguing teens below who immedately clutch their ears with their hands and quiet at the screech of a microphone that magically appears in Danny's hand) Listen up people! If you want your parents back, you're going to have to follow my lead! 
You're right, Dash. Let's follow the other kid that comes from a family of ghost hunters and knows how to work all their gear!(Dash frowns) No takers? All right then who's with me? (Punches fist into the air) 
Just have to know the right words. 
(Previous scene fades to reveal Danny giving orders from the top of the stairs) Paulina, you're good with makeup. I need you to disguise Tucker as an adult, so he can get aboard the pirate ship and dusable it from within. 
(Talking through walkie-talkie and camera pans to Ops center with Sam) Sam, keep scratching. It's our only weapon against that ghost ship. Kwan (hands him a weapon) you're on defense. Protect Sam and keep her on the air. Dash, you're with me on offense. We're going to spring the adults frm the pirate ship. 
Oh yeah! (Dash suddenly grabs him by the shirt) Not me! 
Ok people, (Hands out more weapons to people who all suddenly become dressed in orange jumpsuits) Let's move! 
(Watching the event through binoculars) The fish has swallowed the bait. 
I just have to think like a Fenton. Now if I were my dad where would I put the secret control panal for the Ops center? Some place I would see everytime I come here.(Eyes widen in realization before smiling. Scene changes to Danny opening the fridge) Yep, next to the ham! (Pushes button) 
(Steering the blimp) Steady as she goes and..fire! 
(Preparing gadgetry) On my signal.. Now!(Releases a barrage of Fenton gadgets which latch onto parts of the ship,acting as a means to swing throgh the ghost shield onto the pirate ship, kicking aside members of Youngblood's ship as they do so.) 
(Landing safetly on the deck) Now I'm going-OW! (Zapped by ghost shield) Can't change- ghost shield.(Dash jumps in front of him blasting several ghosts with the Jack o' Nine Tails) 
(Holding the guitar mockingly) Looking for this? 
Bring it on, snotnose. 
He's safe. I- uh rescued him. He sure is cool. (To Paulina) You should totally make out with him. 
Everyone huddle together now! 
Seriously, you need to wrap your mind around the idea of Paulina Fenton. 
Hey, is everyone ok? 
Ow, what was that for?! 
Uh,whatever would give you that idea? 
So I'm grounded for a month while I clean up the damage from the party. 
Still I can't help wondering why Youngblood didn't abandon ship? 
And I still had time to finish Lancer's totally useless book report. [He leaps from the tree, hands on hips in a triumphant position.] Nothing could spoil this day. 
No stopping any time, nitwit. 
[As he turns to look at her.] Well, sometimes I have to use my powers for the greater good. 
Have you seen his grades? 
Find your own hiding spot! I've got dibs on 'Under the Nerds Playing Nerd Poker'. [He points behind himself.] 
Three years? We could be here a while. 
Hiding from Dash. 
C'mon. 
Over there. We can all hide in my house. 
Ah, she hid me from Dash earlier today. I'm just returning the favor. 
You! [He stomps over to where Vlad and the others are sitting.] What are you doing here? 
I don't know what you're up to, Plasmius. Actually, I do. You just told me. 
You know her? 
Stall them! [He runs off..] 
Okay, here we go... 
Oh man! Only you? 
Skulker? 
I dunno. 
But I think Vlad Plasmius just became the least of my worries. 
Of course it was a late night! Every ghost I know- and about a million I don't- ARE LOOSE!! [As he finishes saying this, an Ectopus comes in, laughs, and steals his lunch. Danny now has bags under his eyes.] Not to mention I couldn't sleep because my arch-enemy was in the guest room next to me. 
Hey Val. 
What makes you say that? 
Dash, take a hike, will ya? I'm way too tired to put up with you. Besides, shouldn't you be failing a test, kicking a puppy or beating up somebody weaker than you now? 
He's not gonna see something. [Angrily.] Besides, I'm tired of getting kicked around all the time. [He closes his eyes and folds his arms.] Maybe it's time I do a little kicking back! 
Sam, please, tell Tucker he's nuts. 
Pfft. I can handle it. 
Besides, she's not so bad...once you get to know her. 
They're... Really good friends, and they're just being overprotective. 
Woah! I gotta jet! [He runs off- and right into Dash. He grabs Danny by the collar.] Dash! [Danny notices the Skeleton Armies outside the school.] Uh, look, this is really bad timing, can we reschedule? 
And... There's more where that came from, Baxter! So... Watch it! 
Actually, yeah, it does. 
You're helping me? [He continues to fight off skeletons.] Whaddya want, my mom's cell number? 
She also thinks we're the enemy. 
[Pointing.] That. 
You're welcome. [He frees himself and flies a few feet over. Cut to him and Plasmius.] Look, I know this is going to be hard to believe- [Behind him, Plasmius is tackled by the Fright Knight.] But that guy is the problem right now, and I could really use your help. 
You don't have to trust me. [He extends his hand to her.] Just...fight with me! 
Valerie! 
"The Ring thou hast"? 
[Simultaneously with Plasmius.] Mom! 
Uh... She was like that when I got here. 
It kills ya, doesn't it? How much they love each other? 
Hey guys. 
She's not gonna find out. 
Ring? W-what are you talking about? 
Oh, man, that's gotta be the ring the Fright Knight's looking for! Vlad must've given it to her! 
He's obviously using her to hide the ring from the Fright Knight. Something's going on with that ring, and we need to make the ghosts tell us what it is. 
I'd much rather kick your butt, but this works too! 
Please, tell me what's going on! Let me help you guys! 
It's payback. It helps me on the inside. 
And that's without the Ring. [Close-up.] We can't let him get it! But I'm gonna need all of you to help me put the Ghost King to sleep. 
I'll need you to battle against all odds- [Overhead view of the group.] Face untold danger, doom, and destruction, with no guarantee of ever coming back. [Close-up again.] WHO'S WITH ME? 
You're putting innocent people in danger. It stops. Now. 
That you stole the Ring, woke the Ghost King, gave it to Valerie to hide it and now you're waiting for your chance to steal it back? 
I AM NOTHING LIKE YOU! 
Oh yeah? [He stands up. He looks angry.] Well, if that's the case, then instead of asking you to give the ring back, I'll make you! 
A signal? [He pulls the sword out of the ground.] A signal of what? 
You name it. Fright Knight, Ghost King, Vlad- [He puts his hand on her forehead.] All of my enemies. Everything I thought I could handle, but couldn't. 
Maybe not. But it is my responsibility. 
I thought I was going to have to blast everybody with a ghost ray, but this is much more efficient. 
I'm the only one who has a chance to save our lives. 
I'm afraid I'm gonna hafta ask you to step away from the suit! 
No, it's not. Not anymore. 
Nope. But he is. 
Activate neural receptors... [The neural receptors come out and snap onto his spine. Something pops up on a screen- a picture of a battery.] Initiate powerup sequence... 
Yeah, there we go. [Behind him, Sam and Tucker open up the door onto the roof or...whatever it's called. Danny glances over.] I can see you over there, you know. 
C'mon, guys. You didn't think it was always going to be as easy as shoving the Box Ghost into the Fenton Thermos, did you? I'll be back. 
Guys, I'll be back. 
But... If there's anything you wanted to say to me... Now might be an excellent time to do it. 
Well, that's my cue. [Close-up.] Tuck, I'll need you to drop the Ghost Shield on my way out, okay? 
[Annoyed.] It's not Inviso-Bill! It's Phantom! DANNY PHANTOM! 
Maybe if I tried to pick these guys off one at a time... 
Ha ha! One hundred fold, huh? [Cut to Danny.] THAT doesn't reek! 
Whoa. Okay. Gotta be smart about how much of my own power I use at once. 
[Gleefully.] STILL NOT REEKING! 
Get out of here, guys! It's too dangerous for you to be here! 
How did they cram all of you into the Specter Speeder? 
[Sarcastically.] Guy really knows how to motivate ya. [He obeys Skulker. He flies into the Keep. He reaches the doors to the throne room.] Well, this is it. [He blows the doors open. Standing right there is Pariah Dark, in all his...you know what I'm going to say. Danny groans angrily. Cut to Pariah.] 
Whaddya say... [He flies closer.] We ditch the snappy patter and get right to the part where I kick your butt! 
The power isn't the burden. The burden is in how I use it. And I've been using it poorly lately. [He focuses very, very hard. After a bit of focusing, for the first time, he is able to generate clones. Say hello to Dannies 2, 3, and 4! Danny now has 25% power. The Dannies then fly at Pariah.] 
Now leave my town ALONE! 
I don't have to win. 
I just have to make sure that you lose! 
I don't understand... [Cut to Danny's point of view.] 
[Subconsciously.] Huh, huh...what? 
I can't! What was that all about? [Close-up on Danny.] The ghosts are all off rebuilding their homes, but the Ecto-Skeleton is gone! And what about Vlad? Did he make some sort of pact with the Fright Knight? I-I-I- 
Almost. [He walks up to Dash, unafraid.] 
Actually, I wanted to say... I was sorry. I pulled some pranks on you, and- [Dash looks kinda surprised.] Well, with all the weirdness in the last few days...I'm sorta thinkin' that just because I can do something doesn't mean I...should. 
So... Apology accepted? 
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH! AAHHH! 
[now on screen, with Sam and Tucker at either side] Ghost Zone. 
[clicking X] Ghost Zone. (The spinning portal icon is shown up close again for a moment.] 
[typing on keyboard] All enemies captured, and accounted for [close up of Danny's face], which means, as promised [Danny puts his arms out at full extension to his side as Sam and Tucker smile at him], the 100% ghost-free [showing a table full of pizza, soda, and other various snacks] weekend o'fun starts now. [He presses the "Enter" key.] 
(confused) Hard drive full? Well, hang on, I'll just delete some old--[he clicks on a folder labeled "Personal" with his Danny Phantom D-P logo hybrid as the cover, and out comes a picture of Paulina in a seductive pose] 
[clearly embarrassed, looking at Sam] Uh, haha, how'd that get there? [On the screen, Danny moves the cursor towards a purple skull icon.] Oh, hey, look, uh, here's something I can delete--[Tucker looks up from his PDA worriedly]--this old version of Doomed. [He places the Doomed game over the trash bin] 
(pointing at the computer): Hey, do you know how many digital collectibles I had to trade for that? 
Then I'll just have to be in two places (He begins to contort his face as he prepares for the attempted duplication) - at once! 
Phew. It's starting now. 
Maybe you should just junk this thing and get a new one. 
Ow! (Looking at Tucker) It was just a suggestion! 
(frowning for a second, he smiles relievedly.) 
The way my dad drives. This is faster. 
Absolutely. And if not you can pick us up in 2 hours and 6 minutes. 
2 hours and 26 minutes. 
Um, dad. Is this some new safety feature? 
Sounds like the same old Technus to me. What do you say you shout out your plan and we get this thing over with. 
Um. Boxers or briefs? 
I promised you guys a ghost free weekend-o-fun and now I gotta spend it tracking down Technus. I just wish there was some way I could do both. (Looks up smiling) And maybe there is. 
The Fenton Ghost Catcher. Expunges all things ghostly. 
I mind. My ghost fighting life and my personal life are always interfering with each other. 
Well I will now. 
(looks down at himself) At last! 
I'm Danny Phantom.. Full time superhero. 
Yeah. Sure. Whatever. And I'm gonna partay as Danny Fenton. Full time, uh, fun dude. 
Say, you wear an awful lot of black for a superhero sidekick. Have you considered switching to bright primary colors? 
[chuckles] Now this is more like it, dudes. No responsibilities, no ghost fights, no lame superheroics. 
[chuckles] Looks like that guy's butt already has it covered. (burps loudly) 
[chuckles] Lighten up guys. It's a free country. (The man stands up behind him.) Besides, what can a guy with a wet butt do to us? 
Woah. Bummer. 
No prob. I'll just phase us back in. 
Woah. I can't go ghost. 
Or...we could go bowling. Who's up for bowling? 
Now this is more like it. No distractions, no cumbersome secret identity. More time to dispense my unique brand of ghostly justice. 
Leaping lightning rods! This looks like a job for Danny Phantom! 
You felonious fiend. Your ghost shield prevents me from painfully pummeling you into a pulp. Too bad for you, Danny Phantom is only half ghost. 
H-hey. I can't turn human. 
Sup? 
Ghosts? Who cares? (Slips out of his fathers grip) Going to meet Sam and Tucker at the pier. 
Oh man. This is the life. I wish I could stay on this ride like [chuckles] forever [chuckles]. 
(Popping up from behind Sam and Tucker) Did someone say super? 
Wait a minute. Electric street car. Power line. Generator. You've been recharging yourself all night. Technus 2.0 is a wattage wasting wastrel. 
Relax citizens. Danny Phantom is on the job. 
What? He said "relax". 
Dude. Uh, Dad. I-I don't know about this. 
Dueling dopplegangers. Have you lost your half of our mind? [Lands on the ground.] 
Dude I'm not the one wearing a bed sheet. 
That rampaging robotic rogue is heading for the power plant. We have to stop him before he consumes this city's energy supply. 
What do you mean "we"? That's your job. Uh, besides I can't go ghost. 
No. But you can get past the ghost shield human. 
Cool ride. 
[Flying up behind Fenton] Focus! [Flies in front of Technus 2.0] You want fire power? I'll show you fire power! 
Now let's see how else we can drain his batteries. 
Bingo! 
Uh, okay. When dad asks me "who trashed the van" I am so not covering for you. 
And that's the sort of irresponsible attitude that makes you such a disappointment to our family. 
Uh [chuckles] hello. [chuckles] Not our family. My family. You're the full time superhero, remember? 
Then perhaps it's time we fuse back together! 
I've never felt better in my life. 
[Off-screen] Curse this infernal messy room. [Standing up, hands on his hips] This looks like a job for…the vacuum cleaner! 
Of course I'm myself. I'm more than myself. [Hands on his hips] I'm-- 
Dude. Get out of [throwing Phantom away from himself] me! 
No! We must become one again. 
We didn't become one dude. [Turns to the mirror.] You overshadowed me. [Inspecting himself in the mirror.] 
You're right. Something went horribly awry when I used the Ghost Catcher to duplicate myself. 
I'm more than alright. [Strikes a superhero pose] I'm Danny Fenton! 
Fear not paunchy patriarch. 
Ugh. 
[chuckles] Okay. Uh from now on you hide and I will be Danny. 
I think not. You were Danny all day and did a pretty poor job of it. 
[simultaneously with Phantom] Dude. No! 
[simultaneously with Fenton] Dad. No! 
Going ghost! 
[simultaneously with Phantom] Hey. I can still do that? 
[simultaneously with Fenton] Woah. I can still do that? 
I'll save everyone. You deal with the house hijacking horror. 
Ow. Would it be too much to ask for all of my powers back? 
Eat ghost ray you evil electrical extensions. 
Fizziling phantoms. Are my powers diminished as well? 
At least that one still works. 
That's for totally ruining my weekend-o-fun dude. 
I'm right here mother. 
We have to stop Technus before he [goes ghost] takes over the whole city. 
[chuckles] Good luck dude [chuckles]. 
I only have half our powers. We must do it together. It's your duty. 
H-he said "duty." 
[Grabs Fenton] We have to stop him. 
[Brushes off Phantom] Tried it. Didn't work. Back to bowling. 
Sweet. 
You go inside and get the Ghost Catcher. I'll keep Technus busy. 
Uh how about we all go inside. 
[Phasing through the roof] No one maybe. 
[Coming through a hatch on the roof] But how 'bout two? 
Uh dude. That only works if we're outside the ghost shield. 
I'll save you! 
Oh yes we can. [The Dannys grab Technus' tail.] Together! 
We did it. No. I did it. Alright Technus. It's just you and me now. Me. The one and only Danny Phantom. 
Shouting out your plans again? That is so 1.0. 
Too bad I can't pull together that fun weekend [turns human] I promised you guys. 
Really? 
Um dad. Maybe that could wait until after the summer. 
(Sounding tense) Who me? I'm swell. (Danny looks back out the window.) Every single molecule of me. (Cut to a close-up of Youngblood's ship, then zooms out to show the whole ship with the ghost shield still active. Cut to interior of the submarine where Danny is pressed against the window looking at it.) I just don't think that we should…go in there. 
What? (Danny grasps on to his seat as he shouts) No! (The Fenton sub goes into an opening in the side of the ship. Jack and Maddie happily look around at the sunken ship, while Jazz looks bored and Danny is gripping his seat and looking nervous and/or scared. He looks outside the window and gasps. The area Danny is looking at is empty.) Don't you see it? (Danny visibly shakes and points his finger outside.) How can you not see it? Ghost! 
Look out! 
(Still looking terrified and navigating the vehicle) Are you people blind? 
(Looking back, panicked) We have to get out of here! 
(Danny walks away, going towards one of the windows.) But he was there. (Looking out the window) I-I saw him. (Looking back to address his family) Why couldn't you? 
I'm not crazy! 
(He turns around to face Sam) Crazy? (Visibly shaking) Don't say crazy! 
I-I think I'm starting to see ghosts when there aren't any ghosts. 
Uh. More than a little. Um a lot lately. 
(Speaking to the direction of the empty hallway) You! (Shot pans back and forth across the hallway to show it empty. Jazz looks at Danny concerned.) I might not have been able to do anything last time. (Runs off down the hallway.) But this time I'm going… (bumps into Jazz) going…. 
You…don't see anything? 
Wherever I want. (Danny shakes off Jazz's hand.) What are you the hall monitor? 
Really? 
Are there any studies on the calming effect of big sisters minding their own business? (Danny flinches as something hits his arm.) Ah! (Danny turns to yell at whatever hit him.) Quit it! 
(To Jazz angrily:) Will you stop talking about me like I'm not here? (Something hits behind Danny's back, nudging him forward. He turns around to yell at it:) And will you stop poking me?! 
Back off punk! 
I don't know. What if Jazz is right? What if I am going nuts? 
(Shouting into the air) Yeah! You better run! I see you again I am gonna tear you... 
Welcome to my world. (He slaps Bearbert out of Jazz's hands.) 
It was one ghost! (Danny slumps down in his seat and looks away) ...and a parrot. 
Cowboy? 
Duh. He's riding right next to us! And 70 miles an hour. (Slumping into his seat) Oh no not again. 
I'm not doing anything. 
Cliff! 
Uh. Jazz. You wouldn't consider unlocking those ghost weapons, would ya? 
No reason. Um, excuse me. 
Man, what's Tucker been eating? 
Figment of my imagination or not you need to back off cow brat. 
Who cares? Why can't they see you? 
Wait a minute. (Danny flashes back to his recent encounters with Youngblood) The sub. In school. At my house? (Back in the desert. Danny drops Youngblood.) I was the only kid there. 
Geez can't a guy get two minutes of privacy? 
Go away! 
No you don't. 
Fine. Then I'm going to sleep. 
Jazz. 
You have to unlock the ghost weapons. (Grabs Jazz's shoulders) We're all in danger! 
I know. You think I'm crazy but I'm not. You can't see him because only kids can see him. 
Where? 
Jazz. What are you doing? 
Let me out! 
(To himself) Duh. Ghost powers. 
Jazz! Turn around! Look! (Pointing towards the tent) Mom and dad's tent! 
Or maybe you should act...your age. 
You're not an adult Jazz. You're a kid just like me. 
(sing-songy into the microphone) Jazz is a spazz. Jazz is a spazz. 
(offscreen) I know you are, but what am I? 
(falsetto into the microphone) Will you grow up? 
(Repeating Jazz's motion, speaking in falsetto) Stop mocking me. 
Oh. Oh. (Reaching down and pulling up Bearbert) Who's this? Is this (pulling out a campfire pitchfork and aiming it at Bearbert) Bearbert Einstein? (Jabs the pitchfork into Bearbert) Oh, oh no. 
You have now stooped to my level. Thank you for shopping Fenton Mart. 
I'm going ghost! 
(Standing over Youngblood) Wanna play with the big kids Youngbutt? 
Having fun yet? 
Not so tough now that she can see ya, huh kid? 
Actually I'd just like I can lock you up in jail...or something. 
Quiet, this is important! 
-- the highest score in the history of the C.A.T. -- 
[Flinging his hands in the air, making Jazz flinch back] OK! I get it! You're brilliant, I'm stupid, and I'll never be able to get as high a score as you. [Looking down at his empty sample answer sheet] So far I'm not even qualified to scrape the grease off the Nasty Grill. [flicks his pencil away] 
Ow! [clutching his head, then picking up the boomerang.] A boomerang??? 
 Oh, I give-- 
What's with her? [Turning to look at Box Lunch and flinching] Gah! [He goes ghost.] More importantly, what's with "you'"? 
Um, ew. 
[dropping his face in one hand boredly] Pass. 
Oh, come on! If you actually are the child of the Box Ghost and the Lunch Lady -- ew -- then you know how this ends-- 
[Flying up over the two vats] That's right! He said at the assembly if this stuff gets too hot, kaboom! [He looks over at the condiment station, where there is a box of multicolored Nasty Sauce packets. He picks up one.] 
[sing-song] Box Lunch! [Raising one finger, he sends a focused beam at the Nasty Packet.] BEWARE! 
[helping Sam to her feet] That was Box Lunch, the daughter of the Box Ghost and the Lunch Lady. 
 Actually, it's more of an ew. I don't know what's going on. [Looking down, he notices the CW medallion on the ground.] But this medallion might give us a clue -- [He suddenly notices there is something stuck to his back, and peels it away. It's the C.A.T. answer packet.] Oh my gosh. The answers to the C.A.T.s! 
[holding up the packet triumphantly] Hello, great future! 
Of course I am. [He reverts to human form.] Aren't you? 
I will! I will. I'm just...waiting for the right moment. 
Well, speaking of the future, I think it's time I started preparing for mine. [Picks up his backpack and stands] 
I didn't say cheat. 
[facepalming] Guys, come on. I'd love to have spent the last month studying, but I was fighting ghosts! Besides, if you two think this test is so meaningless [pulling out the answer packet and holding it up], why do you even care if I cheat? Why shouldn't I open this up and study the answers, huh? 
No answer? [Putting the packet on his dresser] Well that's all the answer I need. [He looks down at the packet, hesitating.] 
Who are you supposed to be? 
Skulker and Technus together? 
Definitely a yikes. 
[leaping to his feet] Come on, follow me! [Going intangible, he flies up through the ceiling] 
You're shorting out my powers?! 
The Future? 
What are you two talking aboooou [falling] aaaagh! [he catches himself one-handed on a flagpole. Danny looks up.] Wow. That flagpole thing works? I thought for sure it would [the flagpole snaps] breeaaaak!! [He falls and bounces off an awning into a pile of trash bags.] Guess I don't have a future as an Olympic gymnast. [An arm snakes through the pile and grabs him around the middle, zapping him.] Aaaaaaaugh! [It slams him to the ground.] 
[still trapped in the cuffed arm] Way to go, guys! 
I don't know. The Ghost Zone, I think.[We zoom out to see the entire tower, floating in the green haze of the Ghost Zone.] But...no part of the Ghost Zone I've ever seen. 
[Looking more closely at Tucker's medallion] I don't like this. 
[pushing Sam out of the way] Wow, what is that? [Excited] Some kind of ghostly wail? What a cool power! 
[backtracking quickly] ...If it weren't being used for evil! 
Who are you? Where are we? 
You've got to be kidding me. Name one evil thing I've done! 
I don't have to sit here and explain myself to you! I'm going ghost! 
I'm going ghost! --Whoa. [puts a hand to his head] Serious deja vu. [He goes ghost and flies at Clockwork again.] 
Huh? What happened? [He lands between Tucker and Sam.] 
Nowhere but the future! 
[floating] I don't know. But based on what we just saw, I have a really bad feeling I'm the one responsible. 
Valerie! Listen to me! 
Valerie! 
You thought I was cute? Wow! An older woman likes me. 
[sitting up, panicked] Tucker! Sam! Run! 
They took off their time medallions! [getting to his feet] That returns them to their time period just like Box Lunch and Skulktech! [holding up a medallion] Tucker and Sam made it out alive! [taking hold of his own medallion] Which means I can-- 
Mom? Dad? [rolls to his knees] 
Gone but not forgotten 
[standing] And where's the Nasty Burger? 
[looking down] The time medallion? 
It doesn't matter if I go back in time or not. I'll never turn into you! Never! 
[realizing he's messed up] I'm just kidding! I beat my other self quite easily. Had you guys going there for a second, didn't I? 
Already done! Now, who's up for... [to himself]/what did we used to do together? [out loud] Playing some games and raging against the machine? 
[grunting] Gotta get out of this! I'm going ghost! 
Well, it was worth a shot. 
Box Ghost? 
Ember?! You look.... 
 I was gonna say statuesque, but uh-- 
Johnny 13?! Ok, whatever happened to you, I swear I had nothing to do with-- 
Wait! [The other ghosts close in on him.] No! Nooo! 
 Please! I didn't do all this to you, it wasn't me! 
But--I didn't do any of that! 
Get away. Get away! Get AWAAAAAY! 
Whoa. 
My voice is changing? Great. [he goes back to full ghost mode] I'm going through evil puberty. Everywhere I turn my stupid future is smacking me in the face! [The Booomerang clocks him in the back of the head] OW! ...A note? [he takes the note and throws the boomerang to the side] [reading] Wisconsin? Plasmius. Figures he's involved in this! 
Well, that's Vlad for ya. [We see that he is looking at a gigantic purple football.] Subtle as a flying mallet. [He pushes the football aside to reveal a swirling portal. He jumps through into a dim cave packed with equipment.] 
Defenseless? Old? 
Man. What happened to you? 
What happened to my human self? 
Maybe that's all anybody needs...a second chance. You still have those Ghost Gauntlets? 
Yes. And I can't reach it. But I'm guessing if you could reach into me and rip out my humanity -- which, by the way, sounds totally gross -- you can get the medallion out too! Then I'll pop back to my present like Tucker and Sam did. 
[offscreen] Hey, old man! [Dark Danny stops laughing and turns] [Danny Phantom zips out of the swirling sky wearing a backpack and some kind of rocket belt.] Ready for a blast from your past? 
Don't worry. I won't turn into that. Ever. I promise. [He looks over at Lancer, who is staring back at him.] I guess this sort of explains my periodic absences, huh? 
What are you gonna do? Waste me? What happens to you then? 
Maybe if you'd remembered more about your family, you'd have remembered the Specter Deflector! 
Or the Ghost Gauntlets! 
[getting to all fours and glaring up] Because I promised my family! 
Yes! I PROMISED!  
[landing] I guess the future isn't as set in stone as you think it is. 
[eyes narrowing] Time's up! [Opening a Fenton Thermos, he aims it at Dark Danny and begins to suck him in.] 
[caps the thermos then looks over his shoulder] Oh no. 
I can't go ghost! [he trips on a rock and falls flat on his front] Noo! 
Clockwork? 
You saved them? I-I don't understand! 
You knew all this was going to happen. All of it! [they swoop down to the rescued people] Even this part. 
Um, actually Mr. Lancer, there is. 
I, uh, found this the other day. Outside the Nasty Burger. ['he slides the answer packet across the desk] 
Yeah. I know. A-and, I'm sorry. I couldn't stop myself from looking at the answers. But I'm not a cheater! And I never will be! 
Really? 
So, [looking up at her] how long have you known? 
No, not that. Your headband, your note, [he pulls the note and headband out of his pocket and holds it out to her] your handwriting... 
[raising an eyebrow] Jazz. 
Well, it's our secret now. 
[chuckling] Wouldn't have it any other way. 
[Running and transforming] Going ghost! [confronting the tentacle monster] Hey! Giant, green, and gruesome! Guess who's back and better than ever! 
What’s with you? 
I HATE THE HOLIDAYS! 
(offscreen) If you need me,-- 
--I’ll be in the Ghost Zone 
--getting rid of some frustration. 
(offscreen) You better watch out! 
You better not cry! 
(leaning to the right with his hands flat and down) Santa! (turns in the same pose to the left) No Santa! 
Santa! (turns to the left once more and stares off, looking confused) No Santa! 
*Every year*! 
And I’ve had it! 
(offscreen) *Oops*! 
Sorry, man! 
It was a (lifts his hands with regret) total accident! 
Well, not really, uh, (lifts his left arm and points to the right, then the left) hence the “accident” part. 
“The Fright Before Christmas”? (looks up) I destroyed a Christmas poem? (his head pops up with delight) *AWESOME*! 
Dude, I am *sick* of Christmas! 
I came to the Ghost Zone to get away from it! 
I might not have meant to destroy (straightens up a bit and holds up the page bundle) your stupid book,-- 
--but that doesn’t mean I’m not okay with it. 
Aaaand, (zoom out to reveal all of Danny) you are…? 
Hey, that voice! (looks up) It’s that ghost! (puts his head back down) Whose book I destroyed! 
Wait,-- 
--I’m trapped in his poem? 
Now I’m really annoyed! 
But you can’t *make* me rhyme! 
Some annoying Ghostwriter. 
We’re all being used! 
I blew up his story-- 
--now he’s writing a new one,-- 
--we’re trapped in (lowers his arms, they are still out) by force! 
I’m going ghost! 
I won’t keep this up! 
There’s no poem if I’m silent! 
And you think that I’ll learn it? 
You think you’re that tough? 
*ENOUGH*! 
Can you please let this *die*?! 
You’ve ruined each Christmas! 
Each Christmas and I-- 
--can’t take anymore of this war,-- 
--am I clear? 
Fourteen years (turns the whole way to the house) is enough! 
I am *so* out of here! 
Now you’re ripping off gifts? 
What is that supposed to do? 
Wait, I ruined-- 
--*their* night? 
How’s that for ironic? 
Look! 
What’s a guy gotta do to get out of this book? 
Wait, my problem is clear! 
This poem’s about Christmas-- 
--which is here, here, and here! 
This curse will stay on me from my town to Rome,-- 
--but he can’t Christmas me in a non-Christmas home! 
*Sam*! 
Oh, for crying out loud! 
Are you out of your mind?! 
Aw, nuts! 
You think this can stop me? 
This bear or this train? 
I’ll just fire (alternates arms) away 'til-- 
--no pieces remain! 
Nothing to add? 
Yeah! 
With my Ghostly Wail! 
Give it up! You can’t hide. 
I know just where to find you. 
“Them”? 
Every ghost (raises his right arm) holds this truce?. 
Well, the Ghostwriter broke it! 
I’m trapped in his story! (shirts his arms behind him) The guy’s off his nut! 
It’s over, (holds up a hand to point a finger) you hack! 
I know! (puts down Walker’s arm and grabs the orange) How ‘bout *this*! 
Roses are red, Violets are blue. 
Once these fry-- 
--I’m guessing this lame poem is…-- 
--through? 
*Nooooooo*! 
I’m still talking (puts down his hands and looks at them) in rhyme! 
(VA) With the keyboard all busted, the curse takes its toll. 
The story continues,-- 
--but I’ve no control. 
It’s my fault. (throws out his arm and drops his face into his hand in shame) All my fault-- 
--what happened tonight. 
I spoke out in anger and acted in spite. 
I started this all when I picked-- 
--that first fight. 
But I’d give all I have (looks up sadly) to set everything right. 
(offscreen) Back where they came from? 
But who would--? 
I’ll take it from here. 
(VA) They’re both sort-of right. 
(offscreen) I know I’ve been kinda-- 
--jerk this whole night. (puts down the bag and fiddles through it) So I snuck out-- 
--and found this! 
It’s all of your favorites. 
And here Mom. 
For you. 
And, Jazz? 
(VA) And that’s when I thought 
(VA) Maybe this is the moral: 
(offscreen) In the same way my folks love their old Christmas quarrel,-- 
(offscreen) --everyone celebrates in the way of their choosing. 
(VA) I was so busy whining-- 
--I started abusing the ones I love most and I ruined their cheer. 
(VA) I’ll try to be better,-- 
--come Christmas next year. 
We’re not talking in rhyme? 
(gleefully) *WE’RE NOT TALKING IN RHYME*! 
Sweet! [Becomes visible] No sign of Jazz? 
Good, ever since Jazz found out I was fighting ghosts, she's been kind of--[Cut to Jazz immediately drives up in a pink sedan and parks in front of the movie theater. She tackles Danny against the wall of the movie theater.]--pushy. 
There's no ghost around. If there was my ghost sense would go off. [His ghost sense goes off.] 
Jazz, take it easy. There's a rhythm to these things. Ghost attacks (makes hand gestures), we exchange witty banter, I kick ghost butt, and we all go home having learned a valuable lesson about honest...or something such nonsense. 
[Opens eyes in shock.] What! [Sees Skulker flying away from him.] No attack? He's ignoring me?! 
Bloodstream Nanobots? What are Bloodstream Nanobots? [Skulker turns around shoots out a net towards Danny, who is captured in it.] Hey! [He is trying to break free and sees Skulker floating right pass him and phases through a metal door.] Get back here! [charges up his hands with ecto-energy and bursts from the net with a cry.] You didn't even call me Whelp! 
It's not funny, Tucker! 
Yeah?! 
He did it. [points at Tucker] 
Is it funny now? 
Uh, you mean Skulker? 
But if Jazz think I'm letting her help, maybe she stop interfering as mush. Worth a shot? 
Okay, Jazz. Now! 
You're going up against him with the Anti-Creep Stick? 
Uh, yeah, see. The guts joke would have been better in the last fight. 
Once again, right idea, but wrong fight. 
No, actually, you caught one ghost. Three times. All of them me! 
Look, Jazz. I know your trying to help. 
And please don't be offended but--[A hand suddenly grab him by his shirt and pulls him up out of the car.] 
Ecto-Converter? 
[sing-songy, annoyed] I get it can we let it die now? 
And here I thought you weren't hunting me anymore. 
See, that's more like it. You make demands, I ignore them. 
[Puts his finger on his chin.] Ecto-converter? Ecto-converter, hm, lemme think- oh, here it is. In my hand. [He lifts one hand] 
What do you want with the Ecto-Converter anyway? Or those nanobots you stole from Axion Labs? 
Jazz. [Breaks free from the bolo] Stay away from Skulker. 
No, no. Here. Let me save you the trouble. 
I'm perfectly capable of talking to my own sister. 
Am not. 
Hide me! 
Wait. Where'd you get this? 
You hacked into my private ghost files? How'd you get the password? 
Because it's none of your business! 
Calm down? How can I calm down with you constantly butting your nose in where it doesn't belong. 
Nobody asked you to help! [Jazz flinches back] You're a lousy ghost hunter, an overbearing sister-- 
[Off-screen] and an annoying obnoxious know-it-all with no respect for her brother's privacy. So stop helping! 
Huh? [stretching] Jazz? I haven't seen her since yesterday. Why? 
[to himself] She's after Skulker. 
Um. I mean. [Jumps out of bed and stands across the room.] I'm so upset about her leaving I'm going to skulk...er. [Runs out of the room.] Gotta go! [Running down to the lab.] I told her she was a lousy ghost hunter so of course she decided to prove me wrong and hunt Skulker. But if anything [goes ghost] happens to her, now it's my fault. 
Where is she? 
Not in the mood. All I want to know is what you've done with Jazz. 
Jazz? 
[simultaneously with Jazz] Yes. No. Sorta 
Let her go Vlad. She's clearly just some clueless know it all who got in way over her head. 
Oh yeah? You and what toaster. 
Okay. On my signal, run. 
Fine! 
[Looking towards the control room.] We're gonna have to fight. [Turns to Jazz.] But we're gonna need to make it look convincing. 
[Still on his knees] Okay. I deserved that. And I'm sorry. [Walking over to Jazz, stretching out from being slammed into the shield.] You were just trying to help, but please. Just follow my lead. 
Will you listen to me for once in your life?! 
[over-dramatically] Jazz. No. Don't. Please. 
Barely. [Mimic-mocking Jazz] "Oh no. What have I done?" [chuckles] What was that? 
Actually, I messed up. I was so busy being angry at you I couldn't see that you really can help. 
Consider yourself a reserve member of Team Phantom. 
Nah. I'd rather ride home with my big sister. If that's okay. Besides, I'm sure mom and dad are enjoying their alone time. 
You upgraded to a mullet? 
[Looks down at Valerie and turns to Technus] I am gonna break you in half!!! [He charges at Technus] 
Uh,didn't expect to be here. 
Well, uh, kinda. 
Doesn't it seem weird to you at all? I mean, usually, she's all just WHERE'S THE GHOST! I FIND THAT GHOST I'M GONNA WASTE IT! But she didn't say a word. 
(talking to himself as he types in his reply) I'm fine, but I don't know what to think. How about you? 
You should really give her a chance, Sam. I know she wants to waste Danny Phantom, but did you know she's a ninth-degree black belt? That her favorite fruit is kumquat because it's a funny word? 
Her? W-was there another girl with you? I hadn't noticed. 
No. (falls back against the tree and laughs some more) Okay now, I'm done. You're trying to tell me that Technus is trying to hook me up? C'mon! Technus hates emotions. 
Well, maybe. (Camera pulls back to show Valerie is watching and listening from behind Danny at this point, looking surprised.) But... I don't know... I might. 
(happily) And speaking of Valerie, I'm supposed to meet her before class. 
Technus as matchmaker! Please! 
(uncertainly) It's... nothing. (more confidently) She was probably being paranoid! 
But it doesn't mean she's not right. Valerie's not in there, is she. 
You were pushing Valerie and me together! 
Whadya— 
But... 
Oh, I'm running! Running to get help! 
Valerie's not in there. (After he says this, Valerie crawls out from cover) Which means I'm not holding back! 
Say goodbye, punk! 
Uh, I gotta go. (flies off) 
You should have seen Valerie's face. I'm sure she thinks I was trying to waste her. 
It doesn't matter! If I want to ask Valerie out, I'm gonna have to never tell her I'm Danny Phantom. But first (getting off his bed) I'm gonna get rid of that virus called Technus! Once and for all! 
Does it have to be awkward? 
Check. Advice first? 
A class ring? 
(laughs) You'd be surprised. (holds up ring) I can give her this? 
(Laughs nervously) Of course it's not! You guys are just friends. I even had it engraved. 
Here. (drops some things in Sam's hand.) 
Once Technus leaves here, let me know. (Starts to go toward Axion, then turns back.) Oh, hold this. (A single chime as he puts the ring in Sam's hand.) 
(now flying in a different part of the building) Goth One, this is Clueless One. Why am I “Clueless One”? 
I'm in. (grabs the X-23) And from the looks of the computer, Technus is still in there. 
(caught with the X23 in both hand) Oh, darn it. 
(after dodging Damon's first shot) There's an evil ghost in there trying to take control of your computer satellite! 
We'll see about that! 
Whoaaaa! Hey! I'm an astronaut! 
(doing a loop) Wahoohoohoo! 
Company? What kinda company. (Energy bolt narrowly misses.) 
She's not my girlfriend until I give her the ring. 
Well, she said she'd give up ghost hunting. For me! Besides, I like her, and she likes me back. Isn't it supposed to be that simple? 
Wow. (rising to face her.) I-I'm glad you're here. I, uh, wanted to ask you something. 
Just... friends? B-b-but I thought... 
Ye-eah, right... 
Can you hang on to this? 
So, [Gasps.] how's [Gasps.] the four minute [Gasps.] mile coming, Tucker? 
So what? I have super powers. Why should I even care? 
[Right hand is shown, still glowing from the blast, and then turns to his face.] Ha! Let's see the president do that! [He goes ghost and flies after Skulker.] 
Hey, Skulker, without your suit you're pretty powerless. Maybe you need to learn to rely on your natural abilities! 
I think I liked fighting Skulker better. [Pans out to reveal that he's attempting to do pull ups on a bar in the Casper High gym, with Tucker slumped against them next to him, exhausted.] How many is that? 
And apparently someone doesn't have a sense of humor. 
Hey, when you got super powers, you can afford to be. Besides, why should I care about some stupid fitness test. 
You don’t have super powers. You don’t get to be hilarious. 
Oh crud. I gotta get away from Dash. Ah! Ghost! Run! Run! It's a ghost! 
Run! Run! It's a ghost! 
I didn't. He did. 
Uh, nice image. Here's a better one. We have to move. 
Uh thanks. 
No we're not. All we have to do is get into Fenton Works and unshrink ourselves. Okay, that's not normal. Must've been the wind shear. 
Ten feet. Or at this pace, ten years. 
Hang on. I'll use my powers to phase us through the door. Okay. Can't blame the wind this time. Something's wrong. He's closing in. We've got to find another entrance. 
We have mice? 
I can't. 
Just run. It's good for your heart. 
You watch way too many cartoons. Get back! Oh man. That shrink ray must have shorted out my powers. 
Will you just let it go. 
Dash get down! 
Ew is right. Get back. 
Not for long. Run! Go! Uh dude. Hold this. And this. 
Okay. Just follow my lead and…Dash? 
Dash? 
Dash! Stop! Listen to me. (sigh) Why did you come to Fenton Works? 
Yeah yeah yeah. Can you get to the point? 
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this, I need your help because I'm not strong enough to do this alone. So, fitness buddies? 
Uh, they're special high speed ghost shoes? 
It's mince meat bonehead. 
Dust bunny! 
Thanks. Oh great. I'm losing so much power I'm reverting back to-- 
Uh, um, it's casual Friday? 
Wait. This isn't real grass. 
Have you ever seen him play golf? The only safe place is the hole. 
But we're not nearly close enough. 
Hurry. Out the window and up to the Ops center. Skulker's not following us. Unless he's coming up around the back. Hey Skulker. Still think your abilities beat mine? 
We don’t' have much time. I gotcha. One. Two. Three. Oh man. I'm one makeover away from blowing my secret identity. Good thing Dash is a total moron. 
I don't know. I'm not that good at math. 
That's gotta be the device. 
I'm in here. I need you to pull the trigger, quick. 
Just flip it to uncram and push the trigger! 
Actually, I'm a lot stronger than I thought. 
Yeah well without my powers, that made one of us. So, thanks. I couldn't have wished for a better fitness buddy. Maybe you're not that bad after all. 
Ha. Just like climbing the wires up to the Ops center. 
Well ghost beaten. 
And self worth restored. Ready? 
Hey! if you needed something, you should just axe. Get it? (he chuckles) Axe? 
Yikes! 
(Chuckles) Now, ladies... you can't influence the judge with cookies and--whoa! 
Is this homework done all the way through next semester? 
(smiles) This pleases me. 
(amused) Us? 
What is this April Fools Day? 
(Point a finger out.) Dating her Friday. 
If we live that long! (He clenches his fists and turns towards Tucker.) Could we do this when I'm a little less popular?! (He jumps into the broken rubble of the bleachers and transforms.) 
Mm hmm. 
Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah that's it. 
Sam, look. Whatever it is I can handle it when this little window of popularity is over. But right now I have important judge duties to attend to. 
Ha! Aw crud. 
Dude. You're seriously cutting into my very limited girls are flirting with me time. Ha! Not so tough without your arrows. I don't know why these spooks are going medieval on me. But I'm gonna find out. 
As soon as this pageant is over. 
An insult to modern women? A throw back to the dark ages? And speaking of dark ages. 
You know, I was really hoping we could bury the hatchet. Missed! Or, perhaps not. Later dude. It's been a slice. Okay well, it's official. I'm all out of axe puns. 
Wait! Don't I get a trial? A phone call? A last request? Come on, cut me some slack. Hey another ax pun. Oh man. I'm late for the pageant. 
So that's your big statement? Dora's a ghost? (Chuckles) I mean what…wait. Dora's a ghost? 
Sam! 
Sam! No! 
This is pointless. We don't even know if Sam is in the Ghost Zone. 
The ship just stopped working. 
Oh man. We've got bigger problems. 
Coast is clear. Let's move. Oh man, not these guys again. Uh Tucker. A little help. 
Sam. We're here to rescue you. 
Sam! 
Wedding's canceled, scaly. 
So, you gonna let my friend go? Or do we have to do this the hard way? 
You might want to listen to some of those ideas. I know I should have. 
(Stammering) Wait wait wait wait wait. No. Ugh, I. Y-you don't understand. I never actually picked the winner. 
I have. About a lot of things. And for helping me to do that, I decree our Miss Teenage Happy Princess shall be…Sam Manson. 
Sure but you're buying. I mean, this is the 21st century. 
What was that? Did you say something? 
Yeah your campaign is all about victory through technology and the triumph of machine over man. It's kinda creepy. 
Yeah. That was mine. 
Okay. Okay. Your voice coming up. 
Not now. I'm busy writing in your voice. Would Tucker say it like that? 
I'm going gho-- 
Well geez Tuck, why didn't you say something? 
The way I see it, Tucker has to take the jock vote away from Dash. 
We are. 
Wow. Tucker. You look like a king. 
And you're going down. Sam? 
Time for this mummy to cry uncle. 
Trust me. It's for your own good. 
Yeah. (chuckles) It's your new election campaign. You like it? 
Take it easy, Tuck. We're just trying to help. 
There. They're down. Happy now your highness? Tucker? 
We got your talking points for the debate. 
Yours? Tucker, I-I don't like this. You have to listen to me. 
Tucker. 
Give me that scepter now. 
Tucker. 
Tucker? Sam? 
I'll have to remember this if I ever do a report on the history of road rage. 
I just had the advantage of surprise. Like I do now. 
Long story, and it's not over yet. 
Oh great. That thing's as hard headed as Tucker was. 
Uh oh. 
I can't. Too powerful. 
We do have one shot at this. Tucker, right? You've got to talk to that thing. Command it to stop. 
Maybe. Or maybe it's loyal to the king and for now, that's you. It might listen to you. 
I know. And I'm sorry. 
Not anymore dusty. 
Well now I know why they call these things ruins. 
I gotta admit, it was pretty cool the way you got that Sphinx to listen to you without the scepter. 
Tucker no! 
Nice one. I'll take this one. 
Give it to 'em Tuck. I gotta get this scepter back to the museum. 
Tucker thanks for bailing us out. The Sphinx was a way better listener than Sam and I have been lately. 
Ah, Nasty Burger. Our save haven away from the worries of-[Cut off by Jazz entering dramatically through the duel doors.] 
Run, Why Should I? 
Uh, thanks? 
(Crushed by Maddie's hug.) If I pass out, I give you permission to not resuscitate me. 
[A little more than exasperated.] DAUH! 
Just once, I'd like to know what it's like to live in a normal family. 
Great, more weirdness from my parents's college days. What do you want with me this time, Plasmius? 
Thanks for finding me. 
Please say hospital, please say hospital, please say hospital. [Transition to FentonWorks in quarantine] Why couldn't you say hospital? 
There has to be something we can do for them. 
[Grabbing Vlad by the vest.] I swear, if they find the cure, I'll make you wish they hadn't. 
Time? That gives me a great idea. [Transition to the Clockwork's lair in the Ghost Zone.] 
Send me back in time to my parents's college days, Clockwork. I can prevent the accident that gave Vlad his original case of ecto-acne and his ghost powers. 
Please, Tucker and Sam are my best friends, and I don't have a choice. 
'Destroy the past?' What? And lose all this culture? 
Oh, great. I blend. Ah 'ell, guess it beats people thinking I'm a- [Looks at poster about the ghost portal, bell rings.] 
No ecto-acne, no Plasmius. Mission accomplished. 
Whew, back home, and no quarentine tent either which means everyone's alright. [He sees the FentonWorks building lacking any of it's tech.] I think. [Switching back into Fenton, he barges in. The house looks like it had been ransacked or abandoned with pizza boxes littering the floors.] Uh, Mom? Dad? Jazz? Anyone? [The air catches in Danny's throat as he sees his father in a deceiving animation error as he should be in his 80s garb. Ecno-acne still covering his face.] 
Dad! Relax! 
You are? Geez, that explains almost everything. 
Nothing! Uh, is that ecto-acne? 
I'm your son. I know all about the accident in Wisconsin years ago that shouldn't 'ave happened. 
Guh! Wait! It's me, Danny! Your son! [Dodges another blast.] 
Okay, I didn't want to do this in front of you, but 'going ghost!' [Identical rings to Jack's form around his waist which change him into Phantom's form.] 
I don't understand, that's got to be Dad. He aims like Dad. 
Oh, this is bad. I've gotta get back to Clockwork and change this. [Gasp.] No portal? Okay? Maybe I can squeeze through this stupid thing? Oh, oh no. [A news clipping reads, "WISCONSIN DAIRY KING WEDS COLLEGE SWEETHEART."] I didn't destroy the past, I destroyed the present! [Comerical break.] 'Mr. and Mrs. Vlad Masters?' [Gasp!] 
Dad, uh, Jack, please, just tell me what happened. I mean, I'd love ta here you blather on about the glory days. 
Oh, man. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. 
Vlad wasn't supposed to marry Maddie, you were! I went back in time and changed one little moment in the past and messed up everything. [Jack growls with a shaking fist.] But I can fix it, I swear! I just need a working portal to- 
[He gets thrown out of the building into a billboard, grunting he pushes himself up.] I have to get to the Ghost Zone and find Clockwork. [The Jacks are on the persuit, Danny goes invisible to avoid them.] And if Dad doesn't have a portal, that means I have to find Mom and hope she does. [Danny flies to Vlad's castle, shifting back to his human form he approaches the knocker exhausted. He knocks it a few times, Maddie and Vlad greet him at the door.] 
[He falls to his knees.] Mom. 
My parents are sort of, uh, missing, [He took another bite of the cheese wedge.]' there was an accident. 
[Distressed by the display.] Ah-ha, listen, um, [He places a hand over Vlad's lips.] this might sound like a strange question, but, um, do you guys have a ghost portal by any chance? 
Then why do you have an ecto-foamer? 
[Wincing.] I thought my real parents were embarrassing, this is so much worse.' [At night, Danny goes ghost and searches for any sign of a portal.] Something's wrong here. Even if Mom was crazy enough to marry Vlad, there's no way she'd give up ghost hunting to become a milkmaid. [Diving through the ground.] I knew it! Now all I need is- Ye-yes! A portal! I can get back to Clockwork and- 
[Body blue as he gets sucked inside.] Wait! You don't understand! [Danny groans as he returns to consciousness.] 
Wait, what are you doing!? [The laser fires a fine green light of energized particles, the beam gets close to his arm pit.] Stop! 
I'm- your son. [Maddie gasps.] Yours and Jack Fenton's. 
What? That's insane! He's still totally in love with you. 
The one good thing about having scientist parents- alternate timeline- totally valid excuse. 
It's Danny. 
Eh, [Chuckling.] that's a little complicated. 
Wow, you're good. 
Leave him alone. [There's a look of genuine fear in Vlad's eyes when Danny fires at him, it's visible for less than a second. As Danny dodges, a stray blast sends Maddie flying into the console.] 
Mom! [He charges a shot directly at the tip of the foamer.] 
Wait! [His voice gets louder as the beam neared his limbs.] No! You don't understand! None of this should be happening! 
But- Sam, Tucker- 
That's it. That's it! [Clockwork smiles as Danny flies off to his family, Vlad and friends.] 
Why don't you tell me yourself? 
Uh, yeah, about that. those ecto-impurities you couldn't identify, um, would they be consistent with, oh, say, diet cola. 
There had to be some benefits to being the son of the two smartest ghost hunters on the planet. 
Bygones. [Transition to the Material Grill exterior.] 
Gnarly! [He moonwalks with his parents content.] 
Let's just say I've come to terms with Mom and Dad's past. I wouldn't change it again, even if I could. 
Boo. 
Uh sorry I was late. But you'll be happy to know that the ghost king won't... be... okay. I overslept. 
Oh come on. Name one time. 
In in in. Get in. 
Look out! 
Okay, okay I get it. I'll try to be a little more considerate. (Ghost sense goes off) Starting tomorrow. 
(laughs) Seriously, a bed sheet? What do ya got under there? 
What? Get off me! (Destroys the ghost, and most of the golf course, with a massive ghost ray) Gotta get out of here. 
(over the Fenton Phones) Guys, I'm sorry. But I stuck around somebody could have figured out my secret identity. 
I know. I know. And I appreciate it, but--uh--Can I help you? 
No! Not you. 
Uh, I gotta go. 
Yeah I knew that. How did you? 
Yeah, I know that too. You had enough to eat? 
Then it's time to talk to my parents. 
Look, you say you're my cousin and maybe you are, but we still have to call your parents. 
Hey! Come back! (Finds his room empty) Man she's fast. (Flying out of his room as Danny Phantom) Okay, she's a twelve year old girl. How far could she possible have--(ghost sense goes off) (Chuckles annoyedly) Swell. After the bedsheet ghost, what's this gonna be? A spooky bat on a string? 
Man you look like I do on a bad day, but I'm gonna make you look worse! 
Get out of here. 
How--? 
Night's getting weirder and weirder. And I have a lot of questions. When we get back my parents are--(Dani pretends to faint) And I guess we'll have to answer those questions tomorrow. 
So I hid her in the guest bedroom in the Ops Center and she was gone before I left for school. Are you guys okay? 
Guys, I'm sorry. 
No, I am. I'm sorry. But I was busy with a super-powered cousin I didn't even know I had. 
Can you excuse us for a second? (Quieter to Danielle) Look, you can't just come in here and use your powers like that. 
Wow. You like NASA and you already hate Dash. Maybe we are related. How about you tell me how you got those powers in the first place. 
I-I still have questions. 
(Chuckles) You are on. (They race a bit) No sign of her. I am totally winning. 
What? Vlad? 
Aren't you at least gonna make some stupid crack about my father? Or a lame come on about my mom? 
(Struggling) (To Dani:) Help me. Do something. 
I-I don't understand. 
You've been spying on me? Okay, I've said it before and I'll say it again. You really are one seriously crazed up fruit loop. 
So those ghosts... 
Oh yeah. (Chuckles) Nothing loopy about that. 
Get out of me. 
Which way should I--(Screams as he gets blasted by a ghost ray) 
I'm not gonna fight you. Every time I fight a clone they turn to goop. 
But you're not mindless like those other clones. I don't wanna hurt you. 
He's not going to save you. He's using you. You're nothing but a mess he's not gonna clean up. 
You're helping me now? 
(Chuckles) Nice. 
You don't have to. Cover your ears and get behind me. (Releases his ghostly wail) 
Out of power. But worth it to take this place down. 
Man am I glad to see you. 
(Glomps Tucker) Thank you! (Glomps Sam) Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, you guys! I'll never take you for granted again. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! 
And I wouldn't have gotten out of this without you Danielle. Danielle? Where'd she go? 
I- I can't. I- I didn't. 
Tucker! Sam! Wait up. Did I say thank you? 
Um, did I say I appreciate-- 
Well, (chuckles) seriously. Thank you for-- 
Yeah, I know, but it's not easy. I mean, do you guys realize what it's like to like somebody you can't be with? 
*rolls eyes* Ugh.... 
*ghost sense appears* Well, I'd love to stay and chat but we gotta go... Sam. 
*motions hand out to Tucker* Dime, please. 
Thanks! 
Where'd you go? 
(gasps) 
The Guys in White. 
Nah, I can handle these losers. 
*Jumps back in the air* ...Losers who got better. 
A lot better. 
But I got better, too! 
Now, to rescue Sam and Tucker from the clutches of a smarmy exchange student. 
Will you wear this thing normal? 
Who cares about Gregor? 
Where, in Gregor's locker? 
Look, I'm sorry, Sam. I'm just saying that Gregor-- 
Uh... heh heh... Hi, Gregor. 
Not too much red messing up the whole white thing for you? 
Really? ...Thanks! 
I still don't trust him. 
More on this later. 
Think about it. Gregor shows up, so do the guys in white. He's got the whole white hair-white clothes thing...so do the guys in white! And what's with the phony accent? and that 'Pfft' thing? 
..And I'm saying that maybe I should keep an invisible eye on him and Sam. 
Hey, it's for her own good. 
Oh, man. If they share a strand of that spaghetti, I'm going to hurl. 
Ahh!!! 
Close, but you'll never catch me now! 
What's the matter with you two?? I'm not doing anything! Why can't you leave me alone? 
Hey! I have totally hit puberty! 
See that? Totally a chest hair! 
Could this week get any worse? 
Okay! Now it's officially worse. 
I'm beginning to think that spying is better left to soulless government drones. 
So...uh, Do anything fun last night? 
With Gregor? 
I don't know. Just, uh, checking for pimples, dimples...spaghetti sauce. 
*glares* Niiice. 
Not you! I was spying on Gregor! He's so obviously working with the guys in white! 
Well, I got hit in the face with a rock, Gregor kissed Sam! And the Guys in white attacked again. So there's got to be a connection between them and Gregor. 
Yeah! But apparently that's none of my business. 
Really? To protect Sam? 
This is getting too close for comfort. I need to lay low and let Tucker do his thing. 
*In his room* Hey, Tucker, anything to report? 
I mean, anything about Gregor! 
Great. Now I'm losing both my best friends. 
Gregor, I know you're not what you seem to be and-- ah. Gregor! I know you're up to something, and--! Oh! Come on! Find the words! 
Uh... ah. Oh. Uh. Heh. Sure, Gregor. Uh, what's up? *sits down* 
Gregor, that's not-- 
I-It's not just that. 
Well... 
I know who you are, and I know what you're up to! and-- 
...Somehow, I pictured this chat going differently. 
Danny: H-Have you checked...uh, Dash Baxter? 
*offended* Hey! 
Wait. Gregor can't be a spy for them if they're going after him with guns blazing...and Sam and Tucker are right in the line of fire. 
Where-- 
Oh, no. I'm too late! 
You boys looking for me? 
Guys, I'm only gonna say this once. Stay away from those kids. 
So... I'm sorry. I never should have betrayed your trust by spying on you and your... boyfriend. 
That's totally not true! There are a million reasons a boy can like you-- I mean, you're smart, you're fun, you're cool, you're pretty--- 
...Why am I still talking? I am such a spazz. Still friends? 
(Off-screen) Oh, Crud! Of all the days to oversleep! (Groans and scrubs his hair into it's trademark mess.) Can't have Lancer keep me after on the last day of school, so...(He goes ghost and flies out his window.) I'll just take the aerial route. 
Which is a perfect example of why I won't be going ghost during my Fenton family vacation. 
It's summer! Starting at 3:30, I don't have to listen to anyone for a long, long time. 
Finally! I've been looking forward to this summer vacation forever! The three of us, traveling together cross country seeing the sights. (we see the paper he is holding is a flyer for "Space Camp in Florida".) Cape Canaveral Space Center in sunny Florida... 
But tonight we rock out at the Dumpty Humpty concert! 
Jeez, Jazz, watch it! [He looks down at one of the books she's dropped in surprise, bending to pick it up. The title reads 'Ghost Envy for Dimwits: Ghosts are not the Boss of Me'] "Ghost Envy for Dimwits...ghosts are not the boss of me"? What is this? 
(shoving the book at her) Don't know, don't care, not listening. From now on, it's no more pencils, no more books, and no going ghost so my parents can't tear me apart (gesturing in illustration) molecule by molecule. 
(overshadowing Pam) You know, I think the Fentons are wonderful. Sam should take a cross country trip with them. 
(overshadowing Jeremy) And I agree with you! Let's never speak of this again. 
Uh, let's just say I finally got under their skin. 
Actually, yeah! I've been working on my aim! 
Hey! 
(laughing) What are they gonna do, rust on me? 
[approaching] Show's over, Freak--yahh! 
Let the jerkcicles handle it. I'm on vacation. Besides, two words: 
[putting his hand over the page] Guys, come on! It's summer. As in no more pencils, no more books... 
[taking the book and reading] Frederick Isak Showenhower? [Sam reaches over and folds the page to cover the middle part of the name, so that it reads "FreakShow".] Freakshow? Well-- I don't care, Sam. As of right now [giving her back the book], Freakshow is not my problem. [The band starts playing.] Oh, I love this part! This is where the band comes out of a giant egg. 
Will this vacation ever start? [Looking around, he ducks under the bleachers to go ghost.] 
Show's over, Freakshow! 
Um, nobody saw that, right? 
Really? How? 
I don't think so! Tucker, Sam, grab hold of me. [They do so] I'm going ghost! 
Who can't do anything! 
[Getting to his feet] That Reality Gauntlet explosion must have messed with my ghost powers. 
[taken aback] You're...helping me? 
Ok, I zip in, get my stuff-- 
Well, what choice do I have? The whole world knows my secret! But if I can get the Gauntlet, I can change reality so that none of this ever happened. [Stepping through the front door into the dark living room] Believe me, [flicking on the light] it'll be better for everyone if I just-- [he pauses, seeing something that catches him up short] uh, disappear? 
Where are my mom and dad? What have you done with them? 
I'm only gonna say this once. Let my friends go, and get out of my house! 
Or this! [Running to a curtained wall, he throws back the curtain to reveal a red button behind a glass case labeled "In Case of Fenton Emergency, Break Glass!" Using the hammer hanging there, he breaks the glass and presses the emergency button. Immediately an alarm sounds and a red light starts flashing.] 
The house attacks anything using ecto-energy. I'm going ghost! [He does so, and immediately five different weapons drop out of the ceiling and target him. He quickly reverts to human form and they retract.] Darn! If I go ghost the house will think that I'm an enemy. Run! 
Probably looking for me...or a scalpel to dissect me with. 
[halting and throwing his arms out so his friends don't pass] Ok! 
Three to the Op Center! 
Time to lock up for the night! 
Not quite. [Moving the Emergency Ham, he reveals another red button hidden beneath it. He presses it.] 
I don't know what to do! 
Wait! 
And tell them what? "I'm sorry I've been lying to you, and please don't rip me apart molecule by molecule"? Besides, if they have anything to say to me they can always contact me. [Right on cue, the communications console starts beeping.] Ugh...here we go. 
You miserable freak, why would I ever help you?! [glaring] 
Mom! Dad! 
Three days? But we don't even know where to start looking! 
And I was thinking about the Space Center. 
[pointing as a map drops down behind him] Starting here [indicating Florida]. 
Does it matter? We're not here to have fun. We're here to look for the Reality Gems. 
Going ghost! 
I always wanted to ride on the Space Shuttle, just not on the outside! 
[holding it aloft triumphantly] Yes! 
Ok, I've run the simulation a million times on my computer. 
Ladies and gentlemen, the eagle has landed...intact! 
Yes! [gasps as he sees the GiW agents wheeling back around] 
[pulling the Gem of Life from his belt] Let's just put you someplace where your ghostly energy can't get out. [he drops it into a Fenton Thermos] One Reality Gem found, two to go. 
And now we will. Shall we? 
Uh, sorry about this. [He quickly blasts their phones.] 
[on their way out the door] You gotta watch those roaming charges. 
turning to him angrily] Not if we're in jail! We're trying to save our parents, remember? Wherever they are. 
[cheerfully] Somehow I don't think that'll be necessary. [to the bears] May I have the Gem of Form? 
SweetlyPlease? 
[dropping the Gem of Form into the thermos] Two gems down, one to go. And less than 24 hours to find it. 
[reaching down to pick up a paper] What's this? Oh, great. 
We've just gotta find a train that's headed for the comic book convention without drawing any attention. 
Hm. Everything here looks normal. 
Oh, you know what I mean. I don't think anyone's triggered the Gem of Fantasy yet. 
[looking up at them] Awesome! The Gem of Fantasy turned three regular nerds into superheroes! [Gesturing to them as he turns to Tucker] They can help us rescue our parents! 
[looking up at them] Awesome! The Gem of Fantasy turned three regular nerds into superheroes! [Gesturing to them as he turns to Tucker] They can help us rescue our parents! 
I've gotta get that gem before these geeks do some real damage. 
Hey! I never approved of this! 
Now to finish off the reset of the legion of super-dweebs. 
Not so fast! 
And Freakshow only has one. That means once we find him, we can beat him and take the Gauntlet! [dropping the Gem of Fantasy into the thermos] 
[also oblivious] And we can change reality so that nobody remembers my secret. 
[glancing at the thermos, then standing up and starting to open it, determined] I don't think so. [Some of Lydia's tattoos snatch it from his hands and he tries ineffectively to catch it.] What? Ah! [they drop it into Freakshow's hand] Oh, no. 
[struggling] I can't break free! 
[angrily] Let 'em go, Freakshow! I brought you the gems. We had a deal! 
[still bound and furious] You lied to me! 
Hey, what did you--? Oh man-- 
Psychology? That's it! 
Why wouldn't I smile? So what if you're the most powerful human on earth? [Freakshow traps him between his hands, but Danny phases through.] [tauntingly] No matter what you do, I'm half-ghost, and uh, you're not. 
Oh sure, but can you do this? [Danny stretches and bends unnaturally and easily around the ray. Below, the clowns cheer.] 
[cartwheeling through the air] Ghost powers...[vanishing and reappearing] ghost energy... [flinging several balls of ecto-energy around] ghost, ghost, ghost! 
Ah, half-ghost, technically, but still way cooler than you. 
I think this just got a lot easier. [picking up the thermos, he sucks Freakshow inside.] 
[putting the lid on the thermos] Sucker. 
[landing on the side of the pool] Are you guys ok?! Oh, [waving] Hi Mr. and Mrs. Manson, Mr. and Mrs. Foley. 
I...I'm sorry. Gah! [Jack crushes him in a bear hug] 
[nonplussed] But I lied to you. Over and over for a really long time. If I were you guys, I'd be furious. 
And I appreciate that. [hugging Jack] More than you guys will ever know. [Maddie hugs both of them, then Danny pulls back, looking at the Gauntlet.] Or will ever remember. 
That would be me. 
Ah-ah-ahh... 
Here,[holding up the Fenton Thermos] a gift. 
Oh, and from now on, [sternly] you're gonna leave Danny Fenton and his family alone. 
[raising the Gauntlet, which glows blue] Because he's not the ghost you're looking for. 
So that's it. I set everything back to the way it was before. Nobody knows I'm half-ghost except you two and Jazz. [Looking at the Gauntlet] Now it's time to destroy this thing for good. 
Oh, man. That's right. Everything's back to the way it was. Which means we should be getting ready for our vacation! [He turns eagerly to Sam and Tucker, who look less than thrilled.] 
Yeah, I guess so. All right, then, [going ghost] time to finish this. 
[waving] Have a nice summer! [He flies off over the street, and gets zinged in the rear by another ecto shot] Ow! 
[Lifts arms in triumph.] YES! I really knocked Vlad off his High Horse this time! [Turns to Tuck and Sam.] I mean, can you even imagine his face when the feds busted in on him like that? 
That's my computer!!!! [Operative 'O' smashes Danny's bed with the mallet.] My bed!!! [Operative K smashes the dresser.] My dresser!!! 
MY DAD! 
Thanks for the backup, Sam. I'm glad you're up with your Anti-ghost laws. 
Yeah… and I don't think they acted alone. [Frowns.] 
Better than ever! An invisible wall! Top that, Plasmius! 
Oh no… [Tries to cover himself.] 
Forget about changing the subject Sam! [Sinks into seat.] I'm never gonna live this down… 
[Stands up.] New owner? 
[Faces Vlad in anger.] I get the idea and I don't like it! Believe me, this isn't over yet! [He frowns and walks past Vlad, fuming.] 
Hey dad, is it okay if- 
Vlad Masters for Mayor!? 
Uh, I gotta go… 
They say you can't fight City Hall, but they never said you couldn't fight in it! 
Save it, Plasmius! Whatever you're up to, it ends now! 
Wow. Looks like Vlad's a little rusty, which is all the invitation I need! 
Boohoo! It's that it? You forgot to take your supplements! Have a dose of vitamin ME! 
You lost your edge! Why don't you go back to Wisconsin and look for it? In other words: GET OUT OF MY TOWN! 
Oh man! He's overshadowing the voters! 
DAD! 
[Mutters.] You're telling me… 
[Grabs book.] Hey, I'm taking the biggest hit here! [Stands up and looks at a surveillance camera over his head.] With all this surveillance and restrictions, Vlad is making sure that I can almost never go ghost! 
Which we all know is an absolute load. With me out of the picture, ghosts will be on the lose all over town! 
All those phony attacks were staged! Vlad's convincing everyone that they don't need me anymore… 
McMasters? 
What!? You can't be serious! 
Okay, I really feel like crud now. [Frowns.] There's one thing left to do. I'm goin' gh- 
[Sighs.] Look, this goes against everything I stand for but... I'm sorry I played those stupid pranks on you, and I'm hoping you'll accept my apology and stop making things miserable for me and my friends... [Puckers brows but extends his hand.] Truce? 
OH COME ON! Can you even pretend to have a heart!? I' m doing an effort here! 
But- 
[Stands up dejectedly.] This reeks… I'm ruined. My ghost career is over, my school career is over, every kid at Casper hates me!...er… More than usual… 
[Standing on a lunch table.] Trust me; he's no buddy of mine, or yours! He's just using us! 
So, what do ya say? Are you with us? 
Just what I hoped for! Now it's time to blow Vlad's game once and for all! [Goes ghost.] 
What about I open something up? Like a big can of worms!? 
Uh… really? Okay then! I'll, uh, give it to you straight! [Turns to the crowd.] The Mayor is a phony, and he's hiding a secret that will shock you all! It's time for all the world to know! 
…Vlad Masters is really- 
Okay, you carbon-copy freak! I'm taking you down! 
Let… go of me! 
What!? He's gonna zap his own clone to make himself look good! [Lets struck by an plan.] Unless…. It does just the opposite! I've got an idea! 
[Feigning innocence.] Uuuuugh, uh, wha-? What happened? [Looks sad and broken.] I'm just a hopeless, impressionable teenager who was minding my own business when- [Winks at Sam and Tucker.] - boom! 
[Smiles lightly.] I gotta admit… he's good. 
Yeah, I guess. There's only one problem with that, though. Whenever there's a draw, there's bound to be a rematch… 
Okay Fenton. You've looked evil in the face and defeated it time and again. You can do this. We turn left at Skulker's Island then right at Walker's Jail. Or is it left at Walker's Jail and right at Skulker's Island? 
We're not lost. My expertly drawn map tells me exactly where we are. We just hook a u-turn around this swirling vortex of infinite pain and we're home. Oh wait that's a thumb print. 
Would you guys quit complaining. If we're gonna become a better ghost fighting team we need to know the enemy's territory inside and out so we, uh, don't get lost. 
No, let's just follow them. They're bound to lead us somewhere. 
See? These guys seem to know their way around. We'll be out of here in no time. [Crashes into ice.] 
Is everyone alright? 
Oh man. My dad's gonna kill me. 
Good boy. Nice boy. [Danny dodges Frostbite's fist.] Lay down. [He shoots a plasma blast, knocking Frostbite back and trapping him in a cage of icicles.] Very good. Next we'll work on fetching the paper. 
[Looks up and sees an icicle in Frostbite's shoulder.] Wait a minute. [Shoots out the icicle with a plasma blast.] 
Me? 
Uh [Danny laughs nervously] I--uh-- 
[Frostbite lifts up Danny] Silence, oh Sam of the Very Vegan. 
So this is why they think i'm the Ghost Zone's savior, [Places his gloved hand next to the drawing] because I defeated the Ghost King! [Danny's hand moves upwards to another picture in which Pariah Dark is being pushed into an object by Danny] That's me trapping him in the Sarcophagus of Forever Sleep! 
This is all swell Mr. Frostbite but we're kinda lost and-- 
Any entrance? I thought our portal and Vlad's portal were the only entrances. 
So it not only takes you through Earth but time too? 
[Sam and Tucker stand by the side, holding a part of the map] Wow, thanks! Which way do we go? 
You mean if I say "take us home" it'll take us-- 
[Speaking in Sam's direction] See? I promised I'd get you home. 
We will, Sam. But who says we can't check it out a bit. After all, I am [puts hand to chest] the savior of the Ghost Zone. 
[On the screen] We take a quick trip, come home and send the map back. What's the harm? 
Map take us to... Hey where do we want to go anyway? 
According to the map this is the river of revulsion. 
This is Carnivorous Canyon. The place is one big-- 
MOUTH! 
Well, it's not exactly the Bermuda triangle. 
Oh just for a second or two! We go in, look around, and get out before it closes! I promise! 
Actually, it's "Nothing to fear but fear itself." 
I just wanted to make sure she didn't mess up the one historical quote I actually remember! 
Well, are you guys up for finding another hidden-- 
Let's bail! The longer we're here, the more chance we have of messing something up. 
The portals going to close soon! How the heck did Vlad find us anyway?! 
Are you kidding with the - 
W-what was - 
Thanks Tuck. 
Vlad has the map, he could be anywhere! 
Not as unbelievable as this! What have you done here, Plasmius? 
Stay as long as you want. Just give me the map, you don't understand how powerful it is! 
I'm more of a pummeling guy myself. 
Some ruler! You just set your entire kingdom on fire! 
See what happens when you play ball in the house? 
Come on, guys 
Just give me the map, Plasmius! 
I can get us out of this, but where'd he go, Tucker? 
Sorry that got so out of hand. 
Like how it brought it brought Plasmius here so you could get it back? 
Maybe. 
But for now, I'd say his dreams are on ice! 
So, Johnny! You work alone now? Finally ditched that stupid...(Danny gets grabbed by the Shadow in both hands and is tackled off-screen, Danny screams.) SHADOOOOOOOW! 
Ugh. Talk about urban blight! 
What do you want, Johnny? 
What? W-We never... I-I mean we aren't... Look, Johnny, you can either go back to the Ghost Zone willingly or I can make you go. 
And [points at Shadow] take The Dork of Darkness with you. 
It's a guy thing, Jazz. You wouldn't understand. 
Jazz, c'mon, I need to know that you guys can get along. 
Eh, creepy. Also with two E's. 
Are you reading that out of a book? 
What! 
She... uh... I don't know if I exactly like... uh... well maybe I--[ghost sense goes off] Ooh, never thought I be so happy to see a... [Danny looks up to something shocking.] 
Scratch that. [takes a fighting stance. He bends his elbows and is about to take flight ] Okay, [Jack tuns around to look at Danny] I'm going- [Sees Jack behind him. Pauses] Eh to need better bait [Points one finger upwards] 
Sorry, dad. 
[Off-screen] Hey, ugly, you're scaring the fish! 
What do you want, Skulker? 
Wow! 
No. I can't believe you have a girlfriend. 
Not as much as this! 
It's cool, Dad. I'm alright. 
I know you're up there somewhere. 
Whoa! This girlfriend, I can't imagine, really got you angry! Have you thought about just getting a lonely-guy cat! 
[Points one finger upwards] Rain storm. 
Whew! 
Anymore? 
New pet or is this the girlfriend I've been hearing so much about?! 
Dad? 
Dad. That was awesome. You know, for a fisherman you're not a half bad hunter. 
Actually yeah. Dad's not so bad when you get to know him. 
Ice cream? Together? They're actually getting along? What are they under a spell or something? 
Will you get this thing offa me? 
Yeah. In your head. 
So, why are we even wasting our time here? 
(Jack is still cheering in the background) Ugh. He's probably gonna keep this up until Vlad isn't the mayor anymore. 
I'm sorry, guys. I-I just can't help being embarrassed. And annoyed. It's not like I can turn off my emotions. 
Sorry V-man, looks like your weather machine's a total-- 
Ow! 
Ow! 
Spring rain? Those are 85 mph winds. Dad, how can you blindly ignore the fact that all of this destruction was probably caused by your old college pal? 
How do you know? 
Oof. Plasmius. Nice weather we're having. 
Nice move Plasmius. Unleashing an evil weather ghost just so you could look good to the voters? 
My hero. 
Actually you'll find I'm more than one these days. Ugh come on, come on. (Danny duplicates to form 3 more Dannys) I did it! 
Hey. (Starts glowing red) Quit laughing at me. 
You. (Glows red) Do you have any clue what you've done?! 
No! 
I've gotta go help my parents! 
Back off Masters. 
I-I have felt kinda…tingly since that lighting ball blew up my force field. 
I've heard of having a sunny disposition but this is nuts. 
Hey! You brought the guy here in the first place. 
Me stay with you? Forget it! 
This pleases me. 
(spits out sandwich) Hello? I specifically said no tomato! 
Thanks for taking me to the vid convention, Uncy Vlad. 
Hey no fair! 
Gee. Looks like your rain machine works like a charm Mr. Mayor. 
This has been a great time Uncy Vlad. I really must tie my emotions to the weather more often. And I'm really looking forward ot that foot massage. 
Uncy Vlad? 
Hey guys, perfect timing. I could use your help. I can't believe I'm saying this, but, Tucker I need your virtual reality helmet. 
No problem maestro. Play me like a violin. Hey Vortex! Today's forecast: partly cloudy with a chance of pain! 
Okay Tucker, let's do it. 
Aww such cute animals. They all look so…sad. 
(gasps) Hey Sam. Great day for a picnic, huh? 
And I'm not! 
I'm totally angry. Vlad's ego almost caused the entire town to be destroyed. 
Great. 
Well that's that. Vortex is back with the Observants and the weather is fine. Now we can go back to ignoring Mayor Vlad's little escapades. 
What? He's trying to pin this whole mess on me? 
Okay gang I know this bus is dirty but there are easier ways to wash it. 
There ya go. Wouldn't want you to miss one day of happy therapy inducing school memories. 
Huh. Hero. Now for the cat. Oh. Probably got scared and ran home. And speaking of home. 
I'm now officially nauseous. 
Thanks Jazz. Sometimes I wonder if the best kind of attention is no attention at all. 
Well maybe a few news stories aren't such a bad thing. As long as I'm able maintain a low profile. 
Uh, ew. 
I…uh…eat all your vegetables. 
(backing up) Woah, uh, sorry I can't stay. Uh…wash your hands after using the restroom. 
So much for staying in the shadows. Hey that's it. 
At least this way I'll be totally-- 
…unnoticeable. 
Back to square one. 
Hey that’s…me? I'm going ghost! 
Where'd I…he…it go! 
Duh 
Get away from my sister. 
The ghost defenses. That means… 
What? 
Stop! He's the putrid protoplasm not me. 
Amorpho? I know clowns with scarier names. 
Uh oh. Better they find Fenton than Phantom. What that? Come on. Change back. 
Come on! Come on! 
I wish I knew. 
What is going on? Why can't I change back? (Danny dodges blast) Aah! (He tries to fly up but hits the ceiling). What's the deal? I can't phase either? 
Sorry. Listen I just fought a ghost who looks exactly like me but he can change how he looks. And now I can't change back or turn invisible or intangible. 
I can't change back to Danny Fenton. Me and the other Danny were fighting and we ran into my dad's ecto-stoppo-power-o-fier and I think it's taking away our ghost powers. 
I can't go home. I can't go to school. I can't even walk around in public without getting mobbed. What am I gonna do? 
That means I have to find that other Danny, or Amorpho, or whatever it is before it's too late. 
Nice move, Sam. 
Two of someone? It's gotta be Amporpho. But which one is he? 
Oh no. 
What the? Woah. (Danny falls) So much for that power. 
Uhhh yes citizen. 
Really? Awesome. 
I've been looking for you. We've gotta get back to my house before-- 
And another one bites the dust. Let's go. 
Sam. 
Is that my shirt? 
Oh no. 
You have no idea. You know there are better ways to get noticed. The next time you want attention do what humans do. Streak at sporting events or go on a reality tv show and eat live bugs for money. 
And I just wanted to be left alone. But if we can't fix this (they fly past a billboard of Danny Phantom) I don’t think I'll ever be left alone again. 
We just have to-- 
Um, I can explain. 
Uh, what he means is that he captured me. All by himself. Him. Mr. Lancer. 
Right. (chuckles) But I, um, escaped. 
Yeah. And, so, (turns to Mr. Lancer!Amorpho) now you will pay you cur! 
Take this. 
Okay. Here goes. (successfully changes back) Alright! (inspects his hair) I can change again! 
The spotlight? You can have it. I'm happy just to blend in. Just, do me a favor. I'll leave you alone if you promise to never let me see you around here again. Deal? 
Cool 
Easy. I just told him that my parents were the fearsome Fentons, he freaked out, used his powers to patch me up and brought me home. Looks like you guys are pretty famous in the ghost community. 
Yeah. I guess there's such a thing as too much attention. 
[Shivering] It's like a meat locker to me. Can you turn up the heat? 
I-I dunno. Ever since I got up this morning I just can't seem to get warm. [Danny's hand brushes Tucker's arm] 
[A fly flies across his face as he speaks] I bet I'm coming down with a bug. 
[laughs] I know. Besides Sam there's nothing wrong with a little p-p-progress. 
Going g-g-g-g-ghost! Sorry, I don't have much of a green thumb. [Blasts off Undergrowth's arm] And now neither do you. 
[Building up a giant ecto-blast] He can't regenerate if he's a pile of ashes. [Drops the ecto-blast as he starts shivering] C-c-c-cold. 
Sleep spores. 
Holy hibiscus! The whole city is a giant overgrown backyard. 
[Struggles to break free of the vines holding him] Ugh, man no good. These vines are like steel cables. With sap. 
[Builds up ghost rays, but plants cover his hands] These ghost plants are blocking my ghost energy. Can't go intangible either. 
[Struggling] Danny Phantom bows to no plant! 
You can't win! If I can't stop you someone [shivers] w-w-w-will. 
No! Mom! She's been taken over by the mind vine. 
[Voice cracking] No! Not them! Let them go! 
[Shivering] W-w-w-wait a minute. W-w-w-where's Sam? 
Sam. 
Tucker! 
[Shivers] Back off! 
Sam? 
Already got one, thanks. And I'm still working the [Shivering] b-b-b-bugs out of it. [grunts as he breaks free of the vines] At least they can't reach me up here. No such thing as flying plants. 
He might be everywhere out here. [Shivering] B-b-but I know one place he's not. [Blasts through several vines] [Shivering] T-t-t-too cold. Can't say airborne. [Screams as he falls] 
[Shivering] G-got to get inside. 
The ghost zone. My only chance. 
I always thought you ruled Sam. Just not like this. I'll b-b-be back. And I'll save you. And everyone. [Sam growls] I promise! 
Only one person who can help me. Hope I manage to s-s-steer myself in the r-r-r-right direction. 
Frostbite. Hey wait a minute. Where am I? Where are my clothes? 
Well what I can tell you isn't good. Amity Park, my home, completely overrun by Undergrowth. A psycho, freaky plant ghost. 
Heh, tell me about it. I tried to stop him but I don't remember much once the cold sensation started taking me over. 
How is that possible? 
You mean this is a new ghost power? 
Teach me. When my clothes are ready. [Scene change. They are now in an arena.] Why are there so many of your p-p-people w-watching us. 
You mean they're hoping I'll mess up, huh? 
I-I-I-I c-c-can't. 
Like when? 
My ghost sense? That's been part of this freeze power all along? 
Okay. Here goes. [Screams as he releases a blast of cold] Hey. Wow! [Chuckles] It worked. I feel normal again. No more cold feeling. Way to go Frostbi-- [See's a frozen Frostbite] Um, can I get some hot chocolate over here? 
Well I guess this is goodbye. For now. I don't know how I can ever thank you and your people enough. 
Yeah. I-I just...what if I can't beat him? If I can never go home again. Maybe I could just stay here with you. 
Thanks. [Freezes Frostbite's hand] Uh, sorry. [Turning to the three injured residents] Bye everyone. 
The lab looks like this, I can't imagine the rest of the town. 
This place is deserted. No signs of human life anywhere. I better find Tucker or-- [begins shivering] I control the power. The power doesn't control me. 
Sam, we have to get you out of here 
What? You won't even babysit your cousins. We have to get out of here now. Where's everybody else? 
Our friends. Our families. What are you doing? 
Stop! Please! Sam, you can't let him win. No! Wait! 
Let. Me. Go! 
Bundle up. It's gonna get chilly. Watch out. The weather man predicted a cold snap. Hey cabbage face. Haven't you heard that cold air is bad for the plants? 
Dude, I don't know if you realized this, but you're a terrible father. As a duly deputized protector of Amity Park it's my sincere hope that you've enjoyed your butt-kicking experience. 
Hey, are you guys okay? 
Let's just say I have a whole new respect for nature. [His aura goes back to its normal white as he speaks. His hand glows blue and he forms an ice diamond.] 
I'm... glad you're okay. [He leans in and they touch heads. They look up in surprise as Tucker comes up in a lawnmower] Tucker, what are you doing? $5,000 to cut someone's lawn? 
(offscreen) Ugh. (Fade in to the inside of Danny's room, facing his door.) I am so dead. 
(Danny flops face down on his bed.) Who knew learning stuff and groping for the approval of our peers could be so exhausting. 
And every day's a battle. Especially when I have to battle something. (Turns around to face Sam and Tucker.) Is this it guys? Is the fun over? Is life just downhill from here? 
Well, it was pretty exhaust-- 
How much are you paying? 
Uh, gee dad, maybe we shouldn't… 
Wait just a minute. What about the Fenton portal? If we sell the house how will I--you access the Ghost Zone? 
[Stops pacing to look at Tucker] What's that? Oh. Yeah. [Increasingly dejected] Sure. At Home. 
I know I'm lucky it's just, I'm worried about accessing the Ghost Zone. 
Well, I did put a lock on the Ghost Portal. 
Maybe you're right. 
[Takes a glass] Don't mind if I do. 
Hey, you think you can whip up one of these babies using cheese puffs and bacon. 
You are going down dude. Come on, put up a fight. Ugh, I win. Again. Hobson, you stink at this game. 
Try Tucker again. At least he'll put up a halfway decent fight. 
Tuck! Get over here! I got Caveman Auto Thief. It's rated "E" for "entrails." 
Yeah. Cool, huh? You were right, Tuck. I got it made. 
Thanks to that lock I put on the portal there's been a distinct lack of, uh, "unwanted visitors" lately. Finally I can kick back and relax. 
I've got more important stuff to do. And a cool old guy to do it for me. 
Okay Tuck old pal. It's time to get real and fight like men. 
[laughs] That's what all you robots say. Right Gothbot 9000? 
Round 1 
Anything can be done with money. 
See? That's exactly why I ordered them. Robots don't freak out. They behave according to preset algorithims. These two understand Danny Fenton. 
Relax. I told ya I put a password protected lock on the portal. It's "open sesame." Good one, huh? 
Not "we." I am done. I got it made here. Playing hero takes way too much energy. 
Go ahead, get ticked off. I've got my robot friends to back me up now. 
All I need to hear is game time, dinner time, and milkshake time. And they're programmed to say it. 
Hello? 
No thanks, Hobson. No appetite. 
I'm just going through some stuff. 
I've played my games, bought tons of extra junk, counted my money. Again. It's just not…satisfying. 
Huh. Lately, um, being a rich jerk. 
Not exactly. 
You think? 
Thanks Hobson. Um, there's something the real me needs to help out with. Later. Suddenly got my appetite back. 
Mom? Dad? Is the new portal fin--Huh? Where is everybody? 
Reality Drill, I need to get into the Ghost Zone quick. What's your ETA on breaking through? 
Yeah. Ghost Zone. You're a drill. You're drilling to get to the Ghost Zone, remember? Huh? For novelty purposes only? Wait, you're not really a reality drill? 
Good purchase, dad. 
Woah. It's a Guys in White invasion force. 
I'll never get past them. Stopping the missile from inside the Ghost Zone is still my best bet. And there's only one other way I can think of to get in. 
Now where would that portal be? Okay, think fast. If I were Vlad's portal where would I be. Woah. That is a really big, really ugly painting. Evil dudes are so predictable. There's gotta be a way to open it. 
Goodbye ugly painting, hello Ghost Zone. 
Okay, where am I? The Ghost King's castle? Oh man I'm halfway across the Zone. I need speed. 
Sorry, Johnny. It's for your own good. 
No time Youngblood. Maybe later. If we're all still around. 
Woah. Woah, easy boy. You need me alive. The Ghost Zone is in hard core danger. 
Oh no. No no no no no! 
Just shut up and pull! Fire! 
Nice job, boys. 
We're glad to see you guys, too. 
Yeah that mansion was so big I lost something sort of important to me. Myself. I'm glad to be back. Heck, I'm even sorta looking forward to working hard again. 
I miss being rich already. 
I know. All I got from that was a paper cut. [Mimicking the Box Ghost's pose.] Ooh, so menacing. 
Well, he's attacked seven times, and we've sent him back to the Ghost Zone seven times. I think he's finally gotten the message. [His ghost sense goes off.] 
Hey, bringing your own thermos to our battles now? You know, you could save us some time by showing up already inside it. 
Tasting our doom. And I gotta tell ya, it's a little dry. 
Guys, I think it's time for dessert. 
[Skeptically.] I'm sorry, but, how are shoes scary? 
Looks like the shoe is on the other foot now. [Sam and Tucker look at him flatly.] What? It was the only shoe pun I had. 
Uh, we're fine here. By fine, I mean safer and less humiliated. 
[Cut to close-up of Danny's face] Well, I don't care if I hear beware one more time, I'll- 
[Sighs] Sigh and put down my sandwich. 
Pan-whata? 
[Cut to Danny in pre-transformation pose] Ok! I'm going- oh you know! 
[Cut to Danny, who grunts in pain.] I've never been frogged before. 
[Close-up of Danny's face] How do you know all about this box? 
Well, I'm sending this dark and weird box back where it came from, C.O.D. 
Peggy-who? [Turns his head to look behind him] 
[Looking at Sam] Apparently, you should read more too. [Crouches into battle positions, fists surrounded by ectoenergy] Hey, horse face! Do the words "glue factory" mean anything to you?! 
Fight fire with ice as I always say. [Lowers fists] Or at least I'll start saying it now. 
[Cut to a confused Danny] What? 
That's just- [Gets hit by horse snot and sent flying] -groooooossss! 
Whoa! Ghost. Nasal. Drip. 
I'm trying! 
I...can't hold off anymore. 
You guys help my pare track that thing down before the rest of the city. I'm going to the Ghost Zone to track down this Pandora. 
Well, it's her box. Maybe she can help me get it away from him. 
And help get this stuff back into it. 
I'll be back [closer close-up ] I promise. 
Plagues, pestilence, boy bands; Woah, this is one evil box. 
Unicorns? Now these I know! 
Deal. 
I'm gonna let Pandora punish the Box Ghost, IF I can find her. [Sets Skulker down in what looks like an ice cave] You should be safe here. 
I sure hope things are finally under control at Amity Park. 
Um, excuse me, can you tell me where I can find [The woman turns around]- woah! 
Nasty split ends! 
Maybe all you need, [Looking away and shooting an ectoblast] is a little conditioner. [The blast makes contact and the the snakes fry to nothing but black spikes.] 
[Shouting as she retreats] Actually, that's a really good look for you! 
Pandora's castle [Opens book and reads] "rests on the side of the lightening arch. You will be a-mazed how easy it is to find." 
A-mazed [Cut to a sky view showing the full maze.] A maze [Cuts to Danny's flat expression.] Duh.[Danny drops down into the maze and reads the sign to his right.] "This area protected by minotaurs"? What are those again? 
[Closing the book] Uh, ole? 
No need to- 
attack! 
[Hovering over the figures.] Now that's what I call bullheaded. 
Woah! 
Well, I-I don't mean "woah" like a horse, I mean like a- can you tell me how close I am to Pandora's castle? 
Does that mean you don't know? 
Dude, you need to chill. 
Next time I see you better be on a merry-go-round! 
Ha, better get some sunglasses, Pal! Uh, well, sunglass! Uh, never mind. 
Uh, Pandora? 
Uh, I-I found your box. 
Then this is [Cut to Danny hovering in the sky near the Box Ghost] going to be the shortest rule in history. 
The Box Ghost has never been this powerful before! 
[Cut to Danny] Okay but I should warn you, I'm not very well read. 
[Speeding upwards with a red background and fists charged with ectoenergy] Why don't you show us how? 
How bout you give the box before anyone gets hurt. 
Yeah, I noticed that too. That is about to change. 
I did ask nicely. 
[Cut to trio] You know if you show us how to use the box correctly, we could collect all the evil for you. 
Beware! 
Hey, that is kinda fun to say. 
Oh, no! Dash is going to destroy Tucker! (Walks toward them.) Guys, wait! Violence is never the answer. 
"FENTON THROWS WINNING PASS", "THROWS, WINNING, FENTON." 
I am? I-I-I-I mean I am. (Ghost sense goes off) (To himself:) Speaking of comic book villains. 
Eh, (so panicked that he's sweating) why ware ya telling me? 
Eh, going ghost. 
Hey, Frightnut. (Starts to charge up his hands with cold energy) Do you know the freezing point of metal? (He charges up a blue energy beam in his hands and launches the combined ice blasts.) 
I'm getting an "A+" in science, so that was really more of a rhetorical question. 
C'mon, guys. You know, there's only one girl for me. 
Eh, (chuckles) nice jacket. 
Huh, what, a dream? Woah... (Zoom out to show Danny sitting on a floating piece of rock in the Ghost Zone with rows of purple doors and windows.) More like a nightmare. 
How did I get out all the way here in the middle of the Ghost Zone? 
I remember a shape, dark, a ghost? Did I dream that, too. (Suddenly spots the broken helmet lying a few feet from his feet and picks it up. Cut to a shot of the helmet.) Something tells me that finding out how I got here isn't going to be as half as scary as finding out who (Zoom in on his face) put me here. 
Mom! Dad! Hello! Jazz! Its quiet. Too quiet. 
(Shouting) Mom? Dad? 
No! 
(Yells in pain) What are these stupid things anyway? (Cut to a close-up of the dream helmets) Looks like a tiara for a high-tech princess. (Cut to Danny's face as it turns from concerned to shock and then worry) Princess- Jazz! 
Going Ghost! 
And going to the video tape! 
Woah [(Pans out slightly to include Danny) Rewind. What was that? (Danny hits the rewind button) Hello. Looks like breaking and entering to me. Well, phasing and entering anyway. 
What's happening? Why attack the Fentons? Unless…(Looks out the window) They were putting the whole town to sleep. (gasps) Sam! 
I've got to stop doing that. (To Sam:) Sam, I'll find a way to get this off you. I promise. Maybe Tucker's equipment can shed some light on what's happening. 
Okay, let's see what's playing on Tucker vision. 
A whole new ghost? And yet, he's kinda familiar. (To Tucker:) Thanks Tuck. I'll be back. 
Woah, the whole town's asleep. (Danny's ghost sense goes off. He looks down and sees two sleepwalkers attacking a couple.) Uh oh. 
Let me go! Who are you? What do you want? (They show no reaction.) Strong silent types, huh? Okay. Let's see how strong. 
I don't know where you're taking me but I’m pretty sure I don’t want to go. 
(dusting off his hands) Huh. Not that strong after all. 
Woah. 
A whole freaky (turns visible) ghost army run by a new freaky ghost. Why do I get the feeling Vlad's somehow behind this. 
Well this is definitely a good news bad news moment. But if Vlad's not behind this, who is? 
Hey guys. (Chuckles) Love your individuality. 
Lucky I'm already a student of your creepy ghost moves. 
Pay attention guys. You'll see why I'm not even scared. 
You! 
Look I don't know who you are or why you woke me up. 
Is that all you got? Dude you need to get yourself some new…uh…ghost powers. 
You were the one who sent me into the ghost zone. 
Who are you? What do you want? 
O-okay. I-I get it already. But do you get that I won't let that happen? All that beauty sleep's left me rested and stronger. Not a great idea. 
That'll teach you to steal people's dreams. 
Looks like you need it, you're running out of steam. So what's the big deal about people's dreams. 
Oh man. That was private. 
That's all you do? Put people to sleep? You sure you're not a teacher? 
This is where I say dream on. 
Yeah? Me, too. 
Must be nice getting others to fight your battles. Not so nice, though, when they lose. Time to hibernate! Haha. Sweet dreams. Now to wipe out those sleepwalkers. But to battle an army, I'll need one of my own. 
Okay, how do I remove that headset without lighting myself up like a Christmas tree. Wait a minute. Something obviously woke me up and knocked this thing off me. The question is, what? Woah. Yeah, that'd do it. Okay I don't need to risk getting shocked to remove this thing. I just need to shock Tucker…inside his dream. No big deal. I've overshadowed Tucker before. Just slip inside and…get inside his dream. No sweat. Look out Tucker I'm coming in. 
Nice Tuck. Even your dreams have style. 
Yes, sir. 
Wait, I'm the janitor? 
Hate to cramp your style dude. Actually no I don't. 
Seriously, I'm your janitor? 
Actually, you're now in a worse one. Come on, we gotta free Sam. And just so you know, I don't do windows. 
Oops probably shoulda told you about that. My bad. Don't touch anything else. Now that I know how to do this it'll only take a second. 
The cafeteria? Come on Sam I expected bigger dreams from-- 
Girlfriend? Her dream is just like mine. Uh, her dream is just like mine! 
(Simultaneously with Sam) I didn't seen anything. 
We have another stop to make. We'll explain everything on the way. 
Any objection to me waking up Jazz? 
You guys stay alert. I'll be right back. 
Yep. Dash has really come in handy today. He's like the poster boy for nightmares 
A mattress warehouse. Of course. That new antenna must be receiving signals from all of the headsets. Everyone cool with the plan? 
Sleepwalkers. 
And whatever it's connected to. 
Alright guys. Let's do it! 
You okay? 
Cool. 
Nice teamwork guys. Now let's get Nocturn. 
Oh no. No. Nocturn, he's huge. He's absorbing dreams and getting more powerful. We have to stop him. Ow. 
The stronger he gets. I know. That's why I'm trying to break in and wake him up. Wait a minute, wake him up. We wake him up. The same way I woke all of you. Think about it. You all woke up by being surprised. If I beat him in his dream it'll startle him awake and then we-- 
I don't really have a choice, do I? 
Tuck, you and Jazz stay out here and calibrate your PDA to shut down this dream machine. That should stop the sleepwalkers at least. (To Sam) You sure you want to do this? I've never overshadowed anyone with a partner before. 
You okay? 
Gotta hand it to the guy. He's got a vision. Uh oh. Did he just see us? 
Well this is one dream you're gonna wish you woke up from. 
Why didn't Nocturn wake up? 
Then we'll just have to take back the home field advantage. Let's get out of here. It didn't work. I can't get us out. 
Oh boy. 
Tucker and Jazz did it! 
Sam, will you do the honors? 
In your dreams Nocturn. The antenna's gone and so is your dream machine. Everyone you put to sleep is waking up. You have no power. 
You think everyone will believe this was all a dream 
I, uh, I don't even remember what my dream was about. 
Oh yeah well, dreams. Gateway to the subconscious. (chuckles) I don't think so. 
[Sarcastically] Oh, I'm really excited. Now instead of spending five days a week with these losers, I get to spend two whole months. [As he speaks, someone from the front throws a paper airplane to the back. Kwan catches it and hits Mikey with it.] 
Does it offer a movie theater? Or a video arcade? 
[Excited] Rain Forest Demolition II? Oh-ho sweet! [Grabs the box] Who wants to help me build a virtual Fenton Acres? 
Well, the brochure may be outdated, but at least that sign's accurate. 
Mr. Lancer? Ms. Tetslaff? What are you doing here? 
[Sarcastically] Just what we need: Amateur ghost stories. 
We should check out the woods. 
Psst. Wanna come out and play? 
[Tucker pulls out a Fenton Thermos while Danny pulls out a pair of Fenton Wrist Rays] Thermos and prototype Fenton Wrist Rays courtesy of my unsuspecting dad. 
[Sees footprints.] Guys. Footprints. 
No! Guys! [Leaning over the edge of the cliff to see Sam and Tucker dangling from a tree branch.] 
Here, kitty thing, wanna play fetch? 
Not when I'm doing the fetching! [Pulls out the Fenton Thermos and sucks in the pouncing monster] 
I'm sure the monster didn't eat him. You guys go back to camp, try and sleep. I'll keep looking. [Flies off] 
Just now. When it went from black to gray, I figured it was morning. [Revealing a camera in his hands] 
Yeah, but not Lester. He probably sheltered in a cave. At least the monster's gone. 
Dash, that's impossible! He probably just wandered off to use the bathroom. 
That doubles as a nice normal rescue effort. [Ms. Tetslaff draws a line in the dirt separating the two groups] Quick, Sam jump over to our side! 
[Just as Sam leaves] Wait, you might need the thermos. 
[A sudden fog rolls over] Actually, this is perfect. Stay here while I go check out the woods. [Goes ghost and flies off.] 
[Now appearing on screen] Sticks are so last century. It's all about the ghost rays now. [Beast blasts Danny down] See? 
Uh I kinda left it with Tucker. [Monster attacks but Danny freezes it with an ice ray] Come on, we better warn Tetslaff of the jungle about the monster. 
Anyone else? Tucker! 
[Picks up Tucker's handheld device besides a canoe] Tucker's gone and so is the thermos! 
[Rustling of leaves and movement of a bush] At least one. Going ghost! [Danny transforms and sends an ectoblast at the bush. A large figure is sent flying into the open clearing. He rushes at it only to stop and fall midair.] 
[Establishing shot of the first aid cabin before zooming in to the inside] What is that? 
It's nice to see you again too. [Sam stares at him] What? I had Tucker teach me a little Esperanto. You know, moments like this. 
Well tearing a hole between dimensions can take a lot out of you. 
Of course, they're crawling out of his portal like cockroaches through a sewer drain! Wulf can lead us to it and we can close it up tonight! 
[Sitting outside the cabin with Sam at night.] Don't worry we'll find everyone. 
Come on, you know I'd never let anything happen to either of you. I couldn't imagine my life without you. Or Tucker [Sam blushes] 
[The sound and movement of leaves, Danny stands up] Stay here, wake up Wulf. 
Walker's goons [Creates two ectoballs]. I wondered when you'd show up. 
Tucker's hat! [Ghost Prison Officers disappear back into vegetation and Danny flies back to the campfire where Sam and Wulf are waiting.] Wulf, you need to remember where that portal is, now! [Wulf sniffs the hat, then speeds off, nose to the ground, tracking. Sam and Danny follow behind.] 
Get behind me! [Preparing an ectoblast.] 
Boy, he sure recovered quickly! 
[Emerging from the bushes to a pond fueled by waterfall.] Wow, this is pretty cool. 
So I've heard. 
Another amazing wonder of nature. OK are we ready to break INTO prison? 
Hold on buddy, you can't rush in there, we have a plan. [Shrugging off the duffel bag he'd been carrying.] 
[Floats through the Ghost Zone with the duffel bag, up to the open prison doors.] No guards, we must be expected. [Soars through and drops bag in surprise] Sorry...Wulf. [Shot of Mr. Lancer and the others floating in a substance in a container] Whoa suspended animation, looks a bit like the camp oatmeal. [Reaches out, touches the container, and gets shocked.] Okay, not that way. At least for now I know everyone's safe. 
You brought the whole gang to welcome me! I'm touched. Release my friends. 
You know, you didn't have to kidnap all the campers to get me to bring you Wulf. 
Something tells me Wulf doesn't consider you a friend. [Gives bag.] 
Nice save! [An overhead blast is sent at them.] 
Let's go! [Rounds the corner.] Look. [Turns the wall invisible to expose the others trapped in a state of suspended animation.] 
It's a state of suspended animation that just so happens to look like breakfast. Trust me, they're okay. 
Look you got me, let Sam go! 
You can't scare me, Walker! 
NO! 
Nice job! 
Ready? 
Nice job! Get Wulf and go free Tucker while I keep Walker's army busy. 
You'd know all about that, torturing Wulf, almost torturing Sam! 
What do you say, we put this feud on ice? [Freezes Walker with an ice ray] 
Easy, remember how normal humans can pass through stuff in the Ghost Zone? 
[Pushing the block containing the others.] Wait, where's Wulf? 
[Tapping on the thermos and points it at portal] A little revere polarity should keep Walker in the Ghost Zone for awhile. [Portal closes when thermos ray hits.] Ok, let's get out of here. 
[posing slightly] With my strength? 
[sarcastically] Funny. [To Wulf] You're free, my friend. Run before Sam tries to make another joke! 
Yes Libera, mia amiko (Translation: Free, my friend) 
Whoa! Down boy! 
Yeah, come on. Let's get everyone back to camp. 
But everyone's going to think it was, courtesy of a bad headache from being in suspended animation. 
[Putting a marshmallow on a stick] Wulf is free, Walker's in the Ghost Zone, and we don't have to wake the others till morning. I mean till it's gray again. [Danny's marshmallow catches on fire and he waves around panically till it goes out leaving a charred marshmallow] 
[A shooting star streaks across the sky] Wow. 
We have our own sound track. 
Dad, I really gotta go. Sam and Tucker have been waiting for me for over half an hour to patrol—uh, Pa…troooclus! To do a report on Patroclus! A Greek warrior friend of Achilles. 
Um, any objections to me getting far, far away from here? 
Or embarrassment… Thanks! 
Thanks! I guess I really do absorb some things while I’m sleeping in class. 
What?! My cousin? 
I’ve got this one, guys! 
Danielle? Are you okay? You look awful. What happened to you? Last time I saw you, you flew off kinda dramatically. 
He’s not gonna touch you, Dani. Come on, I’ll protect you. 
Bait?! Was this a trap?! 
You’re not getting anything until you tell me what you did with Dani! 
Just tell me you didn’t hand her over to Vlad! 
You didn’t seem to have any trouble lying to Dani! Listen, I know that we’ve had our issues, and clearly, you’re not big on forgiveness. But Dani doesn’t have anything to do with you hating me! 
Hey! What about the Fentons?! 
True. 
So you want information. 
And what if I don’t feel like talking? 
Valerie! You don’t want to do this! 
Well, yeah! [She shocks him] Aaaaaaah, stop! I’ll tell you about the portals! I’ll give you a map to the Ghost Zone, you can become the hero ghost hunter of Amity Park! But first, you need to let me go, and we need to save Danielle! 
No, because she’s one of yours, a human! She’s not just a ghost. She’s also a girl. 
Valerie, you saw her! Did Dani really look like she could destroy anything? 
Look, the facts are, Danielle’s ghost half is unstable. Vlad is out to destroy her. And if he destroys the ghost half, the human half is destroyed with it! 
Fine! Destroy ghosts! But can you really take part in destroying a human? 
Yes, and no. My da—Jack Fenton tends to be a little of both. For the sake of all ghosts, I keep my eye on these guys and have a pretty good idea of what they’re up to. 
Something tells me we’ll be okay. 
Dani? 
I don’t want to fight you, Vlad. I just want to save Danielle. 
Danielle! Oh, no. Valerie. Did she see me change? 
Well, no time to worry about that now. [He goes ghost] 
Valerie! Why were you standing around? 
Hello? Vlad’s right in front of you! 
I can’t break them, Danielle. There’s only one more thing to try. Feeling brave? 
Well, then, I hope my dad didn’t mend this Achilles’s heel! 
Oh, no! No!! No! Dani… I… I failed you… I’m so sorry. 
Huh? Hey! 
Get Danielle out of here, Valerie. I’ll be right behind you. Man, you really know how to work the system, don’t you? 
Now Valerie blames Vlad Plasmius for trying to destroy Dani, leaving Vlad Masters in the clear. If only she knew you were one and the same. 
Don’t come near her again! [he flies off] Dani, that was awesome! Dani? Valerie, where’s Dani? 
Ha, ha. Very funny. 
That’s what family’s for, cuz! So, uh, now what? Heading off? 
Well, just be safe, okay? 
Deal’s a deal. You helped me save Dani, you may now have me back as your captive. 
What? 
All right! I’m going! [She blasts him in the backside] Ow! What in-- 
And I’ll be ready to play! 
Kitchen's closed, Plasmuis! Give us back the map! [Tucker shoots Vlad again.] 
Let's rock! 
I know you're a lost guy, Vlad, but no map is going to help you find your way. You need therapy for that. 
Seriously Dude. 
Therapy. 
I thought you liked being in space, Sam. [Zoom in some more to just show Danny's head.] All that infinite darkness everywhere. 
Yeah. We'll return it to him as soon as we can. But right now, though, I'm with Sam. [Cut to a frontal view of the three teenagers walked down the sidewalk toward the camera.] It's good to be back to where things are normal. [The trio is interrupted by the sound of a familiar voice on a megaphone. A voice they all knew meant total humiliation.] 
I'm going ghost! [Danny runs into an alley. The camera stays at a view just outside the alley, and a silhouette of him going ghost is shown. Right afterwards, Danny Phantom flew out of the alley with a ghostly tail.] 
Next register, Cyber-jerk! 
[Hitting a building wall then sliding down to the sidewalk.] Great. My first car accident and I'm not even driving yet! 
Hey! [But he found himself too busy gagging to keep smoke out of his lungs as the latter began spreading away from him. By the time his body would let him stop...] Tucker! [Zoom in on his face.] Sam! 
Where Danny Phantom has so obviously failed? 
If Vlad's funding them, then they're definitely up to something. 
You're right. I'll just show 'em who's boss around here. Buckle up guys, Operation: Danny Phantom Rocks is about to begin! 
This is serious, Tucker. As far as this town is concerned, Vlad's goons have totally replaced Danny Phantom. 
Keep working on that. I'm goin' ghost! [Turns into Danny Phantom] Haha. Check this out, everyone. There's not a ghost anywhere that can stand up to Danny Phantom, the original teen ghost fighter! [Blasts a hole in a parade balloon] 
Can we stop talking about my powers, please? They're causing me nothing but problems, lately. I'm starting to think that maybe we'd all be better off without 'em. 
This thing gave me my powers. I wonder if it could-- 
Name one good reason why I should keep my powers. 
That does it! I'm goin' ghost! [Turns into Danny Phantom and flies down to his basement and starts reprogramming the portal] Can't catch ghosts anymore, almost hurt my friends. Now my parents are arrested because of me? [The portal starts up and he steps inside] 
Sorry,m guys. [Pushes a button in the portal] 
[Puts his hand on Sam's] Human. 
[Wakes up] Wha- what happened? Did it work? 
So that means... I'm goin ghost! [Nothing happens] I said goin' ghost. [Still nothing] Haha. It worked! I don't have my ghost powers anymore! I'm normal again. Isn't that awesome? 
Oh, come on, you guys, don't you realize what this means? 
Oh, come on, Sam. think of how great this is gonna be. I won't have to fight ghosts anymore. Now we can all just be normal teenagers and hang out as much as we want. 
It is, thanks. 
Looks like. 
Why is everyone but me bummed about this? Danny Phantom's not needed anymore. From now on, Danny Fenton is just a nice, normal kid from a nice, normal family. Now let's go get Mom & Dad out of jail. 
The Skunk Punks Stink? 
Um, you guys head on home. It's such a nice normal day that I thought I'd kinda walk around and be, you know, normal. 
Don't worry. I plan on being careful for a long, long time. 
Ah this is the life. Just sitting around, not fighting ghosts with my totally ordinary pals. Could you pass me a corndog? Sam. Wait! There's no reason to get mad the corndogs are made of tofu. 
How am I selfish? Because I don't want to endanger the people I care about the most? 
What's wrong with that? 
I care. I just care about you and my family more. 
Blech. Tofu. 
No more sitting on the sidelines. Hang on Dash- 
I'm going ghost! [echoes in the portal] 
I can't believe I'm just sitting here at a computer console when I should be out there stopping this. And I really can't believe we have to do this with him. 
Uh. My dad Jack Fenton is piloting our new-- 
Fenton Rocket. And is on his way to destroy the asteroid. 
Dad. Mission status? 
Detonation in three. Two. One. 
At least he tried, Vlad. What have you done except send others to do your work for you? 
Saturn? Your satellite exploded. That's what moved the asteroid. You're the one who caused this catastrophe. 
Because we've got to see what Vlad's up to. He says he's got new that will impact the entire world. 
No! 
Looks like we either change the name of the Earth to Vladsylvania, or I somehow figure a way out of this mess. 
What if we don't make the asteroid intangible? 
Not if we made the Earth intangible. 
Behold…the addresses of a bazillion ghosts. 
I've got it covered. Come on. The Infi-map can lead us into any entrance into the Ghost Zone anywhere on the Earth. And according to the map one's about to open right here. 
Believe it Jazz. Welcome to the Ghost Zone. Sort of a Ghosts R' Us. 
What others? 
You guys get into the escape pod. 
Wait. You don't under-- 
You just made a big mistake. Well gang, there's good news and bad news. Good news my powers are back. Bad news…my powers are back! 
I know what you mean Sam. Thanks. 
You're right. We better get out of here until we've got this thing figured out. 
Uh, hello there. I have a plan that could save us all from the asteroid. And this one is absolutely free. How great is that? 
Because we're not gonna turn the asteroid intangible, we're gonna turn the Earth intangible. 
That's the plan. Who's with us? 
Tucker Foley will lead the construction team in building the transfer device while Jack and Maddie Fenton's team will spread the transfer cables across the globe. If we all come together, not as separate nations but as one world, we can do this. 
I'm sure. I can move faster on my own. By the way, where do mom and dad think Danny Fenton is right now anyway. 
Gotta go. According to the map a portal is gonna open up over the pole any minute now. 
I-if we make it through this. 
Right. When we make it through this. I have a few things I need to talk to you about. 
Me neither. I--. Wow. Remind me to save the world more often. 
Right on cue. Atomic batteries to power. Turbines to speed. One ghost power source coming up. Okay. One down. Ninety six bazillion to go. Awesome! I think this is gonna work. 
What? 
Wait let me explain. Our worlds are linked. If mine goes yours goes, too. I have a plan. Look, I know you hate my world and wouldn't lift a finger to help it, but I thought you might care about saving your own. 
I still can't believe you guys agreed to help me. Looks like there is a heart under all cyber armor. 
Let's just get this party started. Tucker. How. Much. Longer? 
Where's the asteroid? 
I don't know what to say other than, thanks Skulker. 
What? Uh. Sorry citizens but I have no idea what you're talking about. 
Eh, you know me. I kinda like sitting on the sidelines sometimes. 
Yeah. The time for secrets is over. The world is safe, time for new beginnings. My dad says he even wants me to team up with him now. Says I can be his sidekick. 
Yeah. It's weird, huh? 
What else is new? 
Oh, I wouldn't count on that. Sam, I could never have done any of this without you. And I don't care what's coming next I just hope that whatever it is, you're there to share it with me. 
That's what I'm counting on. 
What do you say, wanna go for a ride? See where the future takes us?
